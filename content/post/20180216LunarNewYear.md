I can't believe I still have to write two more blogposts.

I'm definitely on the edge of just straight up abandoning this entire enterprise.

I should sleep less, blog more.

### General Thoughts
So this entire day was almost entirely a wash, except for at the very end when I had my first REALLY AWESOME pairing session with CW.

The **reason** it was a wash was because a huge group of us decided to go to [Flushing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing,_Queens) for some excellent Chinese cuisine in celebration of the New Year.

That said, I felt extremely positive once the night ended, and I'm really glad I didn't go home after dinner - it almost feels like this project might actually go somewhere.

### What I did
Having gotten in extremely late as per usual, I didn't have too much time to work on things before our whole group absconded deep into Brooklyn for delicious lunar eats.

That said, I decided to tackle one of the many, many pieces left before [open-splendor] is ready to go - routing. I got turned on to this idea after looking at the front-end for [Spyfall](http://spyfall.crabhat.com/) and having some RCers point out to me that the transitions between forms on the page must be done in-app, as the page was not reloading.

So began my adventure into [react-router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/), a library for routing between components without requiring server-side [redirects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_redirection). Specifically, I worked through [this extremely simple introductory tutorial](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/beginner-s-guide-to-react-router-53094349669), which gave me, as these tutorials tend to, an incredibly sparse but technically adequate introduction to working with the library.

LD gave me a quick walkthrough on [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), and resolved a couple of outstanding questions I had on how I might actually deploy my application.

For those of you who know webpack, however, you probably know how little work that actually entails.

By the time we were headed to the restaurant, I was pretty much ready to call the day a complete waste of time.

I mean, the restaurant we ended up going to was [Spring Shabu-Shabu](http://springshabu.com/flushing.html) a decadent all-you-can-eat hotpot experience. I must have eaten my weight in enoki mushrooms.

It was only when we came back, lounging about on beanbag chairs and trying not to fall asleep, that I pulled out my laptop and mentioned off-handedly the trouble I was having to CW - and boy, did that comment pay off!

Since I started RC, I haven't found a lot of value in pairing - sure, I was able to learn a lot by working with much more skilled individuals, but the whole [driver-navigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) paradigm didn't really seem very useful, and most of my pair-programming sessions quickly devolved into a big Q&A.

That said, I found pairing with CW incredibly fulfilling - not only was I able to stay on task throughout, we actually got a lot of work done and now the introductory landing page and submission logic is just about ready to go!

Once I've got something halfway usable, I'll throw it up on a public-facing domain - that actually seems like something that might happen!

I've been feeling pretty down on pair-programming recently, and I think my experience with CW completely turned it on its head.

### What I learned
* Pair-programming can be super great!!
* Intro to react-router
* Mushrooms must either be super cheap or restaurants do not expect the likes of me to step into their doors very often

### Interests/Stuff to work on
* Code up Knapsack problem!
* Splendor in React!
* Morning Golang prep!
* Even more CTF!
* [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/)
* Something in Prolog??
* PICO-8?
* Something with compilers? Maybe just the lexing and parsing side?
* Something in OCaml??
* SOMETHING FUNCTIONAL (programmatically and literally)
* Kubernetes!
* MongoDB!
