I woke up on time today - incredible!

The sheer rocky reality of spending an hour plus on blogging every day is starting to truly weigh on me. Am I but another blaring megaphone shouting empty words into the void?

Yes.

The shouting continues.

### General Thoughts
I got a ton of stuff done today sans caffeine, which was honestly astonishing. I also got absolutely nothing done on my React project. 

I'm not feeling too torn up about it. I suppose, objectively, I actually got almost nothing done today, but its the feeling that counts.

A thought has been steadily germinating in my head over the last couple of days, which is that I think I want to spend way more time pairing. I'm surprised to note how rewarding I find working with people on stuff - maybe it would help me fix my awful Splendor issues too.

### What I did
So almost the entire day was spent working through the first half of [the third MIT problem set](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/assignments/). Normally that would be super frustrating and annoying, but I ended up getting at least a somewhat better understanding of [AVL trees](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/software/AlgAnim/AVL.html), as well as some of their operational constraints.

Aside from the first questions, the majority of our time was spent looking at the [lowest common ancestor for a binary search tree algorithm](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/description/). A lot of my base heuristics were proven wrong, which I'm starting to enjoy.

A lot of my positive feeling about the problem was due to my solution for the very last part of the first question though - prove that the LCA algorithm provided works.

This was my first time really approaching a proof in my own way. I managed to put one together on my own relying heavily on [proof by contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction). I'm sure I approached it wrong (some of the more experienced RCers hinted it had something to do with [loop invariants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_invariant)), but I still really enjoyed the process.

It feels like something is changing a little bit in my brain - I wouldn't have ever thought I could've even attempted a proof like this in the past. Let's hope its for the better.

That said, after spending pretty much the entire day on this tiny question, the group seems to want to maybe be more comfortable just looking up the answer in the future, especially if we're going over our typically prescribed time period.

The second half of the day was spent doing [a pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) meet-and-greet. Instead of just walking around talking, we split off into pairs and paired on implementing a really cool programmatic automaton - [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

The rules of Conway's Game of Life are really simple, but end up having a lot of interesting emergent properties. The rules are simple:

```
Imagine a grid of white and black squares.
White squares are 'DEAD', black squares are 'ALIVE'

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
```

Given these rules, entire [stable, self-replicating structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns) can emerge, some of the most fascinating being [Methusalahs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methuselah_(cellular_automaton)), patterns that evolve and change for many, many generations before finally stabilizing.

I'd heard about it long before I got interested in computer science, and because of that it still held a bit of mysticism in my head. It was very cool getting the chance to implement it with some Recursers I hadn't had the chance to work with yet.

The pairing was structured in a pretty interesting way - three phases, each 20 minutes long, with a new partner each time.

The phases were as follows:

#### Phase 1
```
Implement Conway's Game of Life in whatever language you prefer.
```

Sounded easy enough. It was great pairing with SE, though we didn't get the final code finished!

#### Phase 2
```
Implement Conway's Game of Life. Functions cannot be longer than 3 lines.
```

This was such a sudden spike in complexity! I got to play around with [list comprehensions](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-list-comprehensions-in-python-3) for the first time, all to try to save those precious lines.

Some people did some hilariously janky things, like minifying their entire file afterwards so everything was on a single line.


#### Phase 3
```
Implement Conway's Game of Life. Choose at least one of the constraints:
- No if statements
- No control flow
- No numbers
- No alphanumeric characters
- No computer
```
I was delighted to pair with MR on this final phase, not only because she clearly had a strong grasp on Python, but also because she was really great at [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)). After watching me struggle through my bad habits for twenty minutes, she had a lot of constructive comments about how I could up my Vim game.

I think pairing with people who are better than you is hugely valuable - JK mentioned later that it's not like I would ever have learned Vim commands through conversation.

The constraint we chose was no if-statements. By happenstance, MR had already put together a Game of Life in her last two pairing sessions that didn't require many if-statements - she thought up a really neat algebraic solution (with number of neighbours as input) to decide whether a cell lived or died.

Two teams paired with the 'no computer' constraint - my favourite was 'Soylent Game of Life', where the two RCers organized us into a 5x5 grid and had us randomly initialize as ALIVE or DEAD, scan our neighbours, and live or die by the rules of the game. Hence, [Soylent Game of Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZrar301hRg).
