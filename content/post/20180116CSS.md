I spent the entire day on the RC couches, only moving when it was deemed necessary to relocate to some other couch in some other room.

It was time well spent.

I also rolled in right at 10:30AM - I've been trying to get into the space at around 9:45AM every morning but I think I might just... stop... doing that and sleep instead.

On a depressing note, there was a really interesting/enraging Zulip thread centered around a [blog post a Recurser wrote about dark algorithms](https://jb-rubinovitz.ghost.io/dark-ux-and-health-insurance/). She defines it in the blog post, but basically a dark algorithm is an algorithm that is designed as a dark pattern, which is any design meant for malicious intent. She outlines ways that health insurance companies leverage their website design to improve their bottom line (at the cost of the health and finances of their users). 

In that thread, someone also linked [Inadequate Equilibria](https://equilibriabook.com/toc/), a book about (based on the little I've read) the ways our society has created extremely sub-optimal Nash equilibria, and how that stymies our ability to change negative systems. It totally ate up an hour and a half of my day.

### General Thoughts
Today was shaping up to be extremely unproductive in a negative way - not only was I failing to have any good conversations, I was also getting mega-wrecked and not making any progress at all on any of my personal projects.

I must have picked up and put down four different projects throughout the course of the day, not making any meaningful progress on any of them at all - until the end of the day, when I had an **amazing** conversation with GH. She's a designer working on creative coding for episodes of [Flint is A Place](http://flintisaplace.com/Episodes), 'a cross platform episodic documentary series about Flint, Michigan.'

She gave me a bunch of great advice and my last couple of hours in the space ended up being really productive, at least from a learning standpoint.

### What I did
PABC and VRC both came by and we all started working on [SurviveJS - React](https://survivejs.com/react/) together. It turns out they thought the book was super lame and unhelpful and we all pivoted to [Pro React](http://www.pro-react.com/) - that book is actually way better but I still lost all my progress from yesterday. Also, I learned the hard way that you should still be using git for toy/tutorial projects. I guess it's a good thing we switched books, considering I mega-borked my progress from yesterday anyways.

The first meeting of the [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/) study group was today! As the actual course doesn't have any tutorials or problem sets, we decided to try applying lessons to relevant [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions), specifically [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).

I also went through the second set of lecture slides for the [MIT Algos course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/assignments/). I'm not sure how much mileage I'm going to get out of it - we're meeting tomorrow to discuss our progress and I'll see if I'm still enjoying it.

AR's been trying to set up randomized coffee chats via spreadsheet for the last couple days, but its tough because its so easy for the signal to get lost in the noise. I tried (unsuccessfully) to get through the tutorials for [setting up your own Zulip bots](https://zulipchat.com/api/running-bots). It was a lost cause from the start, I was already sort of tilted and I was in a very hack-y mood (just throwing stuff together and hoping it works instead of approaching it deliberately and methodically), so there's no way I would've made good progress. Something to look at again when I have a clearer head.

The big thing I did today was go through the CSS portion of the [Kanban app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) I'm building as part of the React book - I threw together the React components really quickly, but I wanted to take my time with the CSS as stylesheets have always been a bit of a mystery to me. In fact, if I'm going to be honest with myself, I used to disrespect it.

What a foolish young man I was.

It turns out ALL THE JUICY STUFF is in CSS - [inline-element](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp), [linear-gradient](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp), [z-index](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_z-index.asp), I even finally understand how [position](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp) works... kind of.

It no longer surprises me that AR was able to recreate the famous RC Octopus emoji in pure CSS (I mean, I'm still impressed). CSS is *so powerful*. I realize now that all that time I spent trying to style in-line within my HTML templates was pure folly, plain and simple.

It's changed my entire approach to layout and design, and I feel like this huge chunk of front-end design has demystified. I'm sure I'll soon be brung low by CSS's weighty strength, but until then I'm just enjoying the constant stream of revelation and epiphany ([border-radius! Brilliant!](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_border-radius.asp)).

I think I have a much better sense of how I'm going to approach the front-end of my project - if I can keep the MIT stuff from devouring my entire afternoon I'm going to start building out my components!
