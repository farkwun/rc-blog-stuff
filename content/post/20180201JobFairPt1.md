I'm writing this blog post at like 3 AM in the evening - I ended up staying at RC until past midnight, and the trains stopped running for maintenance so I had to take the bus home.

I'm not complaining or anything, just trying to head off any complaints that this post reads like it was written while drunk - it pretty much was.

### General Thoughts
Today was the first of two job fairs held at RC over this week and the next. I was probably meant to be a bit more nervous about the whole thing, but it turns out that when I reformatted my laptop, I also completely erased the [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) template I was using to generate my resume.

The knowledge was oddly freeing.

In general, I've been having a lot of really positive experiences at RC this week - and it was really fun speaking to the companies in RC's recruiter network. If I had to guess why, I would probably point to the serious productivity I've been experiencing with [open-splendor](https://github.com/farkwun/open-splendor). It honestly feels like I've been learning so much, and I'm especially coming away from the experience with a deep respect for JavaScript and React.

We also did demos today in lieu of our typical regular Thursday presentations! The format was much more relaxed and informal, but due to the way it was set up it was pretty much inevitable to miss at least a couple of demonstrations.

### What I did
As today was one of the [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/) days, the morning was spent catching up on the missed lecture videos. The lesson covered deep learning with [structured data](https://brightplanet.com/2012/06/structured-vs-unstructured-data/), as well as using [torchtext](https://github.com/pytorch/text/tree/master/torchtext) for [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_processing).

The meeting ended up being super hilarious, if not that productive. KS mentioned being interested in pairing with members of the group on using the text-generation deep-learning code provided by fast.ai to generate some text using silly datasets. Some great examples people brought up of using machine learning to generate dumb stuff were:

* [InspiroBot](http://inspirobot.me/), a bot that generates "inspirational quotes" that are then superimposed on stock images - I haven't seen one yet that wasn't absolutely fantastic.
* [ErowidRecruiter](https://twitter.com/erowidrecruiter?lang=en), a Twitter bot that uses [Markov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) to generate text. Of course, the bot was trained on a mashup of [Erowid trip reports](https://erowid.org/experiences/) and tech recruiter emails.

A friend of mine also linked [erowid coin bot](https://mobile.twitter.com/icowid?lang=en) which is much the same except replace tech recruiter emails with [ICO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_coin_offering) whitepapers.

The next part of the day I spent adding more features to [open-splendor](https://github.com/farkwun/open-splendor), drawing ever closer to that sweet, sweet feature-completeness, at least where the game logic and validation is concerned. It still looks awful.

Post-job-fair, I had another amazing conversation with JLC about some of the code smells I was introducing into my code base (or just straight up bad practice, like using [map()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) as a for loop) as well as a quick tutorial on [reduce()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce).

JavaScript is awesome! I've seen these types of functions before in other languages, but I'd never before realized just how much utility they could provide.

Working with [React](https://reactjs.org/) has been paying off way, way more than I thought it would. I'm not just learning about how to put together a front-end, I'm also learning about [immutability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object), [closures and binding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)), and some really solid introductions to [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming).

I had this foolish dream of having the front-end ready to go by demo time - I actually regret not signing up! For some reason I thought the demos were going to be much more formal than they were, I could totally have shown off my sack of garbage app.

Some demos I caught:

* LR put together a networked backgammon written **entirely in [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/)**!
* LW demonstrated a really unique app that procedurally generated story/article templates given a set of photos *through conversation*. Users would put up a set of photos for some date, and the server would use natural language processing to have a conversation with you about your adventures using a set of prompts. Those prompts would then be used, alongside the images you interacted with through the conversation or tagged as being meaningful, to generate a "story template" that you would then be able to fill. I found it oddly humanizing. 
* AB put me to shame with his [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)-style challenge/tutorial set on [SQL Window functions](https://community.modeanalytics.com/sql/tutorial/sql-window-functions/). The shame didn't come from the difficulty of the challenges - the shame came from the fact that he had put it together in just **three days**! For good measure, all the questions are about cats.

Afterwards, we jumped right into the job fair. The companies that came to speak at RC, talk, eat food, drink, and chill were:

* [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)
* [Teachers Pay Teachers](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/)
* [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/)
* [VTS](https://www.vts.com/)
* Windmill
* [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/)
* [Managed by Q](https://www.managedbyq.com/)
* [Eave](https://helloeave.com/)
* [HealthyBytes](https://www.healthybytes.co/)
* [Flocabulary](https://www.flocabulary.com/)

Everyone was really, really nice and approachable, and it was great seeing all the Recursers who are now working at, or even founding, such cool companies.

### What I learned
* JavaScript is super powerful
* Functional programming is a completely new paradigm
* I'm bad at React
* reduce()!

### Interests/Stuff to work on

* Rubocop for Metasploit
* Machine-learning client for Parallel Actors - STANDBY
* Problem Sets for the [MIT Algos course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/assignments/)
* [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/)
* Something in Prolog??
* PICO-8?
* Something with compilers? Maybe just the lexing and parsing side?
* Something in OCaml??
* SOMETHING FUNCTIONAL (programmatically and literally)
* Kubernetes!
* MongoDB!
