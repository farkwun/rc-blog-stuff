title: "Week 5 Wrap Up!"

By the next wrap up, I'll be halfway done with RC!

I've been strongly considering extending my batch, though, especially because I would otherwise just be doing nothing in Toronto for three months.

Also, if I extend my batch, I'll get to be in New York for [Never Graduate week](https://www.recurse.com/blog/114-never-graduate-week-2017-how-we-planned-and-ran-our-annual-alumni-week), an alumni-focussed annual pseudo-conference psuedo-hackathon! It's one of a number of bonuses to consider. 

Of course, the main downside is I will be spending even more money. That's not so great.

I've committed myself to making a decision once the six-week park is past, and the earlier I do so the better so I can move my flight back around. Let's see if I actually follow through on that commitment.

### Quick Weekend Thoughts
So this weekend was pretty great, but for a fairly odd reason - it was my turn to clean the apartment! That included the bathrooms, the kitchen, and all of the rugs. I spent the entire day half-naked wiping down every available surface, running up and down from the laundry room in the lobby, and mopping the entire common area.

I know that sounds like drugdgery, but it was actually really satisfying. I don't think I'd be at all interested in doing it if I was the only person who lived here, but I guess the social pressure is quite the motivator.

I also think I might have been looking for something simple I could make real, notable progress on - Friday's Social day really took the wind out of my sails. It was nice having something tangible to work on, even if I smelled like bleach for the rest of the weekend.

I also washed all my sheets! Everything is so clean, the floors aren't weirdly grimy, and my bed smells gently fragrant. And not in the usual way.

Other than that, though, the weekend was pretty unproductive - I even went into RC on Sunday night! I spent a lot of my time there doing personal stuff though, like answering emails. I was supposed to run a mock interview, but the interviewee rescheduled, so I ended up accidentallly wandering into a mock interview with KN instead!

The question he asked me was an odd one, and I can't even find it on Google, though it's likely to be just an issue of missing keywords. Apparently, this question is a famous Google interview question that got retired because it got too popular. I did find [this Stack Overflow post on it though](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12905663/given-list-of-2d-points-find-the-point-closest-to-all-other-points). 

Basically, through an extremely painful series of struggling deductions, I arrived at an NlogN solution to the problem (which essentially boiled down to finding the median point along the X and Y axes, then determining their intersection). However, KN introduced me to [quickselect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quickselect), which is a more specialized application of [quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort). I should've known!

At first I was kind of annoyed, as I had wanted to actually get some work done on [open-splendor](https://github.com/farkwun/open-splendor), but looking back on it all it was pretty valuable, especially because it introduced me to a new technique for breaking down algorithm problems.

### Major Thoughts
I feel like I took the positive feelings from the previous week way too far this week - I did a lot of socializing, and spent some very late nights at RC.

I don't regret those nights, particularly because I feel like those first two days were super productive, but I do kind of wish the rest of the week had been like that as well.

I think I was really disappopinted at how the [EvlzCTF](https://evlzctf.in/challenges) turned out, as I still feel like I hardly have any understanding of how to approach and break down a [CTF](https://blogs.cisco.com/perspectives/cyber-security-capture-the-flag-ctf-what-is-it) challenge. I'm just kind of muddling along, not making any progress, and the social day definitely didn't help.

Of course, it was really nice connecting with other Recursers, especially as the group of RCers on the CTF team are super cool, but the upcoming halfway mark is definitely producing its fair share of anxiety.

As well, I think now that refactoring is more or less done, I'm kind of slacking off on porting everything to Redux. I've kind of been holding off on making any real progress to that end, and I've just been skimming the first couple of chapters of [the Redux documentation](https://redux.js.org/). JC recommended [this Redux course](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux) but I really don't feel like videos are for me.

Maybe it's just because docs give me more control over my own destiny.

We'll see how I feel about it.

It's also probably important to mention how drastically my performance has fallen off regarding the [MIT algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/assignments/) course. I wonder if I'm just avoiding the pain of trying to work out all the gross coding exercises (and avoiding learning as well), or if I'm just starting to learn to optimize for my own interest. It doesn't help that I get the sense that everyone is kind of feeling the same way - we didn't even have our regular Friday meeting this week!

The [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/) group is doing some really cool stuff - I should probably try to catch up with them. Everyone seems to be doing [NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_processing), and I've been mostly stuck in refactoring land.

That said, as much as I want to hate on it, [refactoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring) was incredibly fulfilling and satisfying, and seeing all of those [linter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) errors disappear couldn't have been more great.

Again though, I wonder if it's all just me avoiding stuff I don't understand - [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [building my own API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface), and designing a back-end from scratch.

Maybe I only enjoyed it because I kind of knew what I was doing!

The major highlights this week were:

* Failure talks on Tuesday - some of the projects people had failed on were unbelievably cool
* CODING BEE WAS AMAZING
* Refactoring my code into something I'm actually proud of
* Getting [ESLint](https://eslint.org) finally working, and implementing [PropTypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html), as stupid as it might sound. It's just satisfying getting my tools working and improving the quality of my codebase.

### Work Done
I did a TON of work refactoring open-splendor, and I've been skirting having to port everything to Redux probably because of it.

I don't want to ruin my beautiful codebase!

For that reason, I really probably did not get a lot of Real Work done (that is, shipping features) and I'm definitely at a point now where I should be able to get something up and running, if not this week then by the next. Only thing holding me back is me. 

I'm really glad I got [port forwarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding) working with [NGINX](https://nginx.org/en/), even if the actual work involved was fairly trivial. At this point, Redux is the final layer before I go all-in on my backend.

I guess I also got a tiny CTF done, but it hardly feels like a meaningful achievement.

### Big Lessons
I feel like I did everything backwards with open-splendor - first I wrote a bunch of garbage code, THEN I refactored it a bunch, THEN I got my linter working, and only THEN did I implement PropTypes!

I'm pretty sure that's the exact opposite order of how I was supposed to go about things - starting with the nice quality of life and and quality of code parts, and only then actually writing out features.

Oh well. [ALE](https://github.com/w0rp/ale) is the bomb.

I also think I learned something about what the balance of social and productive I need to feel good about what I did that day. Maybe I'm just a miserly grump though.

### Next Week Goals
I didn't present!!

I ended up mid-refactor 5 minutes before presentations were about to start, so I didn't think it would be a smart move to just wing it.

Next week, I'm going to set the somewhat more tangible goal of moving everything to Redux by end of week. 

I'll present if the slots aren't crammed full of Winter 1s trying to do a final presentation!

### Interests/Stuff to work on
* Splendor in React!
* Morning Golang prep!
* Even more CTF!
* Problem Sets for the [MIT Algos course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/assignments/)
* [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/)
* Something in Prolog??
* PICO-8?
* Something with compilers? Maybe just the lexing and parsing side?
* Something in OCaml??
* SOMETHING FUNCTIONAL (programmatically and literally)
* Kubernetes!
* MongoDB!
