title: "New Batch!!"

I am FINALLY CAUGHT UP ON BLOG POSTS. The last three blog posts were actually written TODAY, during RC TIME.

I gotta say, I was pretty close to just not writing a post for today, but down that way madness lies.

What did I even write in those last three posts? Were they formatted correctly? Were they even correctly dated?

I definitely didn't check and I definitely do not care.

We're back!

### General Thoughts
The new batch came in today and it was a real whirlwind trying to actually get any work done.

Of course, there were mad potatoes, toast, and eggs available for the taking, and I didn't hesitate to inhale my weight in carbs.

I also only slept like 3 hours last night, so I also went hard on that free coffee.

Normally, cups and cups of black coffee end up fritzing me super hard - it's probably troubling that I just kind of went up to normal.

The new batch is really friendly, but also dead quiet - there was a moment in the space where there was complete silence, *despite* the entire room being pretty well packed to the brim with people.

Everyone seems really friendly - I'm excited to get to interact with all the new people in the space.

### What I did
Basically, I resigned myself to not getting anything done well in advance of the new batch actually starting, and spent the entire day just working through my blog backlog. 

It's too bad because I totally could've gotten actual work done - everybody was so quiet and focussed, and by the time I was actually sitting down and working, I still had just enough of that residual caffeination to feel motivated.

That said, if I hadn't finished writing all these posts today there's a really good chance I just wouldn't have written them at all, so maye it worked out.

I also spent an unexpected few hours getting set up for an [all-new MIT course study group on Operating Systems](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-828-operating-system-engineering-fall-2012/) - what am I even doing?? It was kind of interesting going through [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) and setting up [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) - Vagrant was already installed on my machine so I must have used it at least once since I've gotten to RC, but I feel like I have a somewhat better understanding of how it all works together.

I'm going to try to be a lot more brutal about timeboxing though - let's see how interesting the course ends up being. Having to spend multiple hours getting set up doesn't seem entirely encouraging.

### What I learned
