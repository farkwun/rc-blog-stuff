So at this point (Monday), I've allowed around 4 blog posts pile up, notably the Big Halfway Point roundup. 

Seems like a metaphor for something.

Anyways, here are some blog posts that are incredibly late.

As per my typical modus operandi, I'm going to be dating them as if I wrote them on time, because as I've mentioned before, this is my blog and I do whatever I want.

### General Thoughts
It's honestly pretty tough even reasoning about what happened on this day so far in the future, but if I don't write about it now all the details are for sure going to slip from my mind.

I actually presented today! I kind of wish I hadn't though. I feel so bad presenting stuff that isn't ready - it feels pointless, even if multiple RCers have assured me it isn't.

Today was also the end-of-batch party for the Winter 1s! It turns out a lot of them ended up extending though, so I won't be saying goodbye to too many friends.

### What I did
Honestly, I ended up at RC at like 1pm, and the time between then and presentations was pretty short.

If it weren't for my commit history I'd hardly even know what I accomplished.

The "morning" (probably more like 1pm) was spent writing niceties for the outgoing Recursers that are given to them when they [never graduate](https://www.recurse.com/about). Niceties are just small notes that individuals write for those leaving (totally optional), and can include memorable projects, thoughts, or just general positivity. Of course, I started writing my niceties an hour and a half *after* they officially closed, but the RC staff was really nice about extending the deadline for me.

As for my increasingly ridiculous goal to present, which I think I may have even left off of the last Weekly Wrap-Up, I was pretty torn on it until the very last minute. Still, I felt I should, considering so many RCers were leaving, and because of that, I spent the latter half of the day doing some more refactoring on [open-splendor](https://github.com/farkwun/open-splendor) - mostly tweaking the CSS a bit to add some hover animations and cleaning up the UI as best I could.

Even so, it was hardly at a presentable place by the time presentations started. I think I may have had a somewhat intimidating conversation with LD about [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), and while I think it's a valuable thing to learn, I still don't feel comfortable moving that deeply into the backend, especially since the front-end still isn't quite where it needs to be.

The game is more or less working, but I definitely need a login-style page like [Spyfall](http://spyfall.crabhat.com/). Right now, you can just play Splendor on your own computer (if that - I still haven't ported in all the cards and nobles and things). I need to start really thinking about the database, though my only goal this week was to get the project to the point where I'm ready to do so.

I'm not so sure I'm going to be successful.

Despite all of my inclinations, I signed up to present only minutes before the actual deadline (as per classic Bryan stylin'). Here were the presentations given on the very last week of Winter 1:

* VRC presented the work he's done so far on a [dynamic A* path-finding algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) visualization. Apparently, the resources he'd found online didn't allow him to easily create obstacles to better understand how the algorithm approaches path-finding. It's in [React](https://reactjs.org/) and everything! What am I even doing with my life?
* AKR did a brief talk on working with [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/), notably a problem she helped KS navigate in which somehow all of KS' commits for a hackathon got assigned the wrong author while still being attached to her public key.
* AM did a truly disgusting talk about [PICO-8 token optimizations](https://github.com/seleb/PICO-8-Token-Optimizations). It turns out that the [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) constrains programs to a maximum of 8192 tokens, but some operations don't cost tokens. From this relatively innocuous start, some incredibly filthy optimizations can be done to save tokens at the cost of a complete lack of readability. It was a hilarious, awful, hilarious talk.
* GH updated us on the progress of her police-dispatch visualizer for [Flint is a Place](http://flintisaplace.com/About). She added small sound clips of the actual radio dispatch audio - it makes for a really great effect. Her episode, [05. FPD](http://flintisaplace.com/Episodes) will be out soon, but you should definitely check out some of the other episodes, which are basically beautiful webpages and vignettes about life in Flint, Michigan.
* CM presented the new features she's added to her Chrome extension for organizing one's bookmarks - apparently also in React! Everything I'm doing sucks!
* KDM showed off his Markov-chain-based movie title generator, as well as the beginnings of a web-scraper meant to help detect fake news
* I did a stupid presentation on my garbage dump, [open-splendor](https://github.com/farkwun/open-splendor)
* CW did a positively delightful talk on his new project, the [New Yorken Poesry Magazeine](https://github.com/connorwalsh/new-yorken-poesry-magazine), a poetry magazine by AI, for AI - no humans allowed! The basic idea is to have AIs submit poetry that other AIs will vote on, and the top submissions will be published each issue. I strongly encourage you to read his project description - it's amazing. He also contrived the presentation as just a mysterious project that one day appeared on his GitHub profile, completely out of his own control. After all - no humans allowed.

The presentations were amazing, but I felt extra bad because my presentation seemed so bad-tacular in comparison. I do think there's value in presenting even if you don't have a finished product, and that's also what I would definitely tell someone if they were asking me for advice - I suppose I'm just a massive hypocrite.

Afterwards, the RC staff gave out shirts and read out some choice niceties for each leaving Recurser, and the space transformed into a big party room! There was pizza, and drinks (ER gave me a sipful of whiskey that was actually SO DELICIOUS), and dancing! I didn't bring dance shoes so I just danced in my socks - the resulting blisters were not worth it.

### What I learned
* Developing for the [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) is hilarious
* Dancing in socks is dumb
* Presenting half-finished projects feel mega bad

### Interests/Stuff to work on
* Code up Knapsack problem!
* Splendor in React!
* Morning Golang prep!
* Even more CTF!
* [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/)
* Something in Prolog??
* PICO-8?
* Something with compilers? Maybe just the lexing and parsing side?
* Something in OCaml??
* SOMETHING FUNCTIONAL (programmatically and literally)
* Kubernetes!
* MongoDB!
