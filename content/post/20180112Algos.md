Today (Friday) isn't technically an official RC day. The space is open all the time though so if I wanted every day could be an RC day - but I feel like I should do laundry and be a lazy slacker at least every once in awhile.

It's only been five days but it feels like so much has happened. Maybe I'll write a weekly wrap-up every Saturday - or maybe this will be the wrap-up. Keep the readership on their toes.

### General Thoughts
So today was pretty much all in on algorithms, specifically the ones in [Problem Set 1 of the 006 MIT Algorithms course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/assignments/). 

I started the day working through the latter half of the problem set with PABC, and then immediately into the scheduled discussion period with LW. It was pretty humbling because the general problem the problem set was discussing was peak-finding - an algorithm I felt like I had a pretty good handle on visualizing. Still, we ended up discussing the algorithms for hours, notably trying to prove correctness rigorously instead of relying on instinct or heuristics. 

I really think if this is going to continue we need to set up some reasonable time limits for getting stuck on stuff - we ended up converging pretty close the actual answers, but I don't think it was worth the multiple hours we spent hashing it out.

Today was also the last day of the Mini 1 batch, an experimental batch format that RC tried publicly for the first time - only one week! A lot of familiar faces will be gone next Monday. 

Upside - there was farewell pizza and a bunch more presentations!

Update on [Parallel Actors](https://github.com/farkwun/ParallelActors) - that project has forsaken me. I'll come back to it when I'm less salty about getting wrecked.

### What I did
I figure I should at least provide some background on the MIT Problem Set for people who are interested. If you aren't down for algo stuff, you can always skip this part or I dunno man read something else.

So there's the canonical find-peak problem in a one-dimensional array (where a peak is defined as some value in an array that is greater than or equal to both its neighbors (or just one of its neighbours if its on the very edges of the array), and the problem set builds off of that to finding a peak in a two-dimensional array (the only valid neighbours are up, down, left, right - no diagonals). They provided four algorithms to achieve this task:

1) Column Bifurcation

```
1. Find the middle column of the subarray
2. Get the max number of the column
3. Check the left and right neighbours - if both are less than the number (or if the subarray is a single column), the peak is that max number. Else, recurse using the subarray half containing the larger neighbour.
```

2) Directed Walk

```
1. Start in the upper-left-hand corner
2. Check neighbours. If all are less than the value at the current index, the peak is found. Else, walk in the direction of the largest neighbour.
3. Repeat
```

3) Quadrants with Best-Seen

```
1. Create a cross of the middle column and the middle row of the subarray
2. Find the largest value on the cross. For a subarray of size 1x1, just return that value.
3. Check the neighbours of that location. If no greater neighbours, the peak is found.
4. If no saved max-so-far value, or the greatest neighbour is equal to that value, then save the largest value seen so far and recurse using the subarray quadrant containing the largest neighbour.
5. Else, if the greatest neighbour is smaller than the saved max-so-far value, recurse using the subarray quadrant containing the largest neighbour.
```

4) Row-Column Bifurcation with Best-Seen

```
1. Find the middle row/column (alternating) of the subarray
2. Get the max number of the row/column 
3. Check the left and right neighbours - if both are less than the number, or it is a one-dimensional subarray, the peak is the max value. 
4. If no saved max-so-far value, or the greatest neighbour is equal to that value, then save the largest value seen so far and recurse using the subarray half containing the largest neighbour.
5. Else, if the greatest neighbour is smaller than the saved max-so-far value, recurse using the subarray half containing the largest neighbour.
```

Man, that was really boring to write out. 

The problem set had us do a complexity analysis on these algorithms (simple), verify correctness (one of them doesn't work - do you know which?), and prove correctness mathematically.

The proof for Algorithm 1 was provided - it goes like this. 

We want to prove two things - that the algorithm provides a location, and that that location is an actual peak.

First things first - Algorithm 1 cannot return an empty location unless an empty subarray is passed to Algorithm 1. In order for Algorithm 1 to be passed an empty subarray (as the subarrays divide by 2), Algorithm 1 must have, in the previous step, been passed a subarray of size NUM_ROWS x 1. Because the algorithm finds the max of the column, and because the max of a column is trivially the peak in that column, Algorithm 1 must not fail to return a location.

Secondly, can we prove that Algorithm 1 returns a peak? We can do this by contradiction. Assume Algorithm 1 returned some location that was not a peak, (r1, c1). This is only possible if c1 was next to a dividing column c2. If the location is not a peak, then this can only be if (r1, c2) is larger than (r1,c1). However, because we recursed in some direction from the dividing line in order to get to c1 in the first place, there must be some maximum value in c2, (r2, c2), that is less than a value in c1, (r2, c1).

(r1, c1) is less than (r1, c2) is less than (r2, c2) is less than (r1, c2). But in order for (r1, c1) to have been returned, it must have been the max of the column, so it's not possible and bam we've proved that it is correct.

If you're interested in the other proofs, check them out [here](Contradiction://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/assignments/MIT6_006F11_ps1_sol.pdf). If you don't get it, don't worry - we cheated a bunch.

The process of approaching an algorithm like this was quite fascinating but extremely exhausting. Immediately, after, though were a new set of presentations!

You're going to get a presentation breakdown at least once a week, but you get two this time!

* BE's been working on using [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics), [Clojure](https://clojure.org/), [Voronoi diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram), and [K-d trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) to make truly devilish jigsaw puzzles - she even laser-cut a couple and left them around RC to vex us. She even added code to support [whimsy pieces](https://www.wentworthpuzzles.com/customer/pages/whimsies)!
* GL did a cool live-coding session on a Ruby interepreter he built out, and had some interesting insights on how [tail recursion](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tail-recursion/) is handled and how it can blow up the stack if used incorrectly.
* MB did a quick presentation about struggling to learn more about machine code and the [abstract syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) built out by compilers - ideally so that she can use this tree to develop automatically generated tests for applications.
* JC did a hilarious demo of his [VisiCalc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisiCalc) built on top of the [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php). Not only did he want spreadsheets, he wanted to have to edit spreadsheets in 8-bit and only 4 characters at a time.
* ID wrote an *AMAZING* brain-hack for [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) junkies in [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Go](https://golang.org/) and [SQLiSqlite3te](https://www.sqlite.org/). He was frustrated with so-called 'productivity' extensions for Chrome and felt that he was never able to trick his brain into not constantly refreshing Hacker News instead of doing actual work - so he built [Slow HN](https://www.slow-hn.com/), a visually-similar brain-fooling version of Hacker News that aggregates Hacker News posts over a user-specified time period and only updates once every couple of hours (or days or weeks).
* BG presented a number of bugs he resolved in the [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) implementation
* DS presented her deep-dive into [WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL), culminating into a magnificent pink triangle moving back and forth on the screen
* SH presented a number of really interesting process behaviours she found while trying to get a good handle on processor utilization and scheduling on the Linux kernel
* CJH presented an 'infinite-scroll' in-browser game/simulation
* JA presented a project about turning the RC space into something more queryable - using a custom language built around natural language requests to derive and display information about a given environment. He mentioned maybe setting up sensors all over the space to really 1984 this place up.
