So I split the blog post into Days 1 and 2, because this is my blog and I get to do whatever I want.

Also, I don't remember much of yesterday because I had three cups of coffee - three more than I usually ever drink.

### General Thoughts
I thought I'd be a bit more productive today, though I guess I managed to stand up the blog and might have settled on a project.

I ended up talking to a ton of people though and getting some really good insight on some technologies and projects and stuff, so maybe it wasn't just a waste of time.

I guess just through talking about it with people, I realized I might have a cool project that is relatively plausible to get going by the end of the week, namely putting together a machine-learning client for Parallel Actors. It kind of feels like cheating though. The idea right now is to start putting together some sort of evolutionary neural net by randomly initializing weights and choosing the best survivors, but it seems a little dumb.

### What I did
The day started with a meet-and-greet speed-dating-ish session where we ran around and had three-minute conversations with randomly matched Recursers for thirty minutes. It was actually really great! I got to speak with LW in person, who is starting up an Algorithms and Data Structures study group. I also spoke with KN who put together a Scrabble solver using prefix tries (http://www.wordswithfiends.com/), as well as SwoleBot, a Zulip bot that messages everyone subscribed to it to do 10 push-ups, 15 squats, and a 60-second plank *EVERY SINGLE HOUR*. I'm really out of shape.

Outside of the meet-and-greet, I got to speak with JM who, like several others, mentioned [nand2tetris](http://nand2tetris.org/), an online course that goes from NAND gates all the way up to tetris. He showed me some of his ALU code which was very very much like VHDL.

I also got to talk to KS who put together a machine learning study group, specifically working with [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/). AR also mentioned [Explorable Explanations](http://explorabl.es/) which is a really interesting idea, though I didn't get a chance to look at it much. She also mentioned [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) as a way to get started with some practical applications of ML. I clicked on a [random one about classifying ships and icebergs from satellite data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/statoil-iceberg-classifier-challenge) and it was really interesting. That group is going to start working through that stuff next week Tuesday, which I guess is why I had it on the brain later in the evening.

After that, there were even more group conversations! I've been really interested in software at scale and SH, an SRE working for Github, hosted a discussion about Kubernetes and a bit of Docker. Even if it was a bit over my head. The group recommended a couple of resources like [Kubernetes The Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) and [MiniKube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube).

Immediately following the Kubernetes chat, there was a panel from the Winter 1's about scheduling and accountability. I got some generally calming advice about allowing myself to enjoy this period of completely-overwhelmed-no-idea-what-I'm-doing-ness. RS also mentioned [The Improvement Kata](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mrother/The_Improvement_Kata.html) as one way to keep yourself on track.

Afterwards, I helped AK debug her Flask application, which was probably one of the more productive things I actually ended up doing. I also finished up this blog and decided to make daily posts. If you're interested in a little bit more self-reference, I've just decided I'm probably not going to edit these even a little bit so you're just gonna have to dea l wth t.

Near the end of the night I looked up [Mar I/O](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44) because I recalled it suddenly and I realized that there were a lot of similarities to what I was trying to get working for Parallel Actors. Again, it seems kind of stupid to just randomly generate a bunch of neural nets and let the best ones reproduce (that is, not super programmatic), but it might be something cool just to get finished this week. I'm probably massively over-estimating my abilities though.

One of the last things I did was talk to AM about the projects she's been doing - games! She's a game designer and at RC she's been working on building out games for the [PICO-8 Fantasy Console](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), a 'fantasy console for making, sharing and playing tiny games' in Lua. Instead of just talking to me about it, she asked me if I wanted to play her game -it was **FANTASTIC**. She said she's only been working on the project for six weeks, but it was at an absolutely insane level of polish. It was also brutally hard and excellently designed - needless to say, I got fully bodied. The PICO-8 actually lets you do full game design on the console itself, and there's a cute 8-bit Lua terminal, even if its not very practical.

### What I learned
* Minimal amounts of Kubernetes

### Interests/Stuff to Work On

* Rubocop for Metasploit
* Machine-learning client for Parallel Actors
* Problem Set 1 of the [MIT Algos course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/assignments/)
* [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/)
* Something in Prolog??
* PICO-8?
* Something with compilers? Maybe just the lexing and parsing side?
* Hugo blog -- UP AND RUNNING
