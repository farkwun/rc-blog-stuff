On Monday, January 8th, 2018, I started my first day of the Winter 2 batch for the Recurse Center in Lower Manhattan.

I got the chance to talk to a lot of Winter 1 batch people and some of them mentioned how useful it was for them to write stuff down to stay on track and keep your thoughts in order.

It is now Day 2 of the Winter 2 batch, and man, do I ever need to write some of this stuff down. 

In the interest of synthesis and accountability, I'll try to do a daily blog post about what I did, what I learned, and what I found interesting that day. Sorry if it's not interesting to read.

### General Thoughts
Everyone at RC is really super smart, and there are a ton of really incredible projects. A number of people seem to have independently decided to work on compilers and/or lisp interpreters - totally out of my comfort zone!

### What I did
The day started with some breakfast and a welcome keynote, followed by the social rules skit. I ended up talking briefly with a ton of people, notably JF, who gave me a crash course on Prolog and showed me a ton of crazy stuff. Prolog is so interesting! It was such an incredible departure from any language I've ever worked on. I especially liked its application to the famous [five houses riddle](https://udel.edu/~os/riddle.html), and how it so simplifies solving these kinds of problems programmatically.

I also got to talk with JK who walked me through his heat diffusion image compression codec, notably about how he was leveraging GPU memory architecture to get speedups. He also mentioned [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/), a neural net course he's been working through.

I did want to get a small amount of work done, so I set up the subdomain for the blog, installed Hugo, and started fiddling with it to get it working with Nginx.

We also had dinner at Budda Bhodai, a vegetarian kosher Chinese food place - it was really good! I talked to TY who gave me a run-down on how a compiler works, from lexing and parsing raw text to get tokens and building an expression tree, to tree compressions to simplify operations, and finally walking the tree to generate machine code.

We also got approached by a guy who thought we were a cadre of revolutionaries, but I think that was JK's fault.

### What I learned
* Intro to Prolog
* Intro to Compilers

### Interests/Stuff to Work On
* Rubocop for Metasploit
* Machine-learning client for Parallel Actors
* Hugo blog
