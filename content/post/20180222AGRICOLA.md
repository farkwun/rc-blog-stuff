I've been running into a terrible habit of leaving off all of my Thurs-Sun blog posts until the literal last day, which is forcing me to write a bunch of blog posts in a single day.

It kind of feels like I'm missing the entire point of daily blog, which is at least partially synthesize what I've been working on each day and lend some fresh perspective.

I mean, I could also blog to be entertaining, but I feel like that ship sailed long ago.

### General Thoughts
Broadly, the day was satisfying from a social perspective but not really from a work perspective.

As the astute reader may have noted, I've been spending a lot of late nights at RC. This may come as a surprise to many of you.

Because of that, I missed the first meeting of the [Operating Systems study group](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-828-operating-system-engineering-fall-2012/)!

I also missed the [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/) meeting!

Basically, the day was filled of missed meeting and unfulfilled obligations. A part of me says that I'm just winnowing down what it is I'm actually interested in but it still doesn't feel great. I could just be missing out on stuff and being generally garbage-ish.

Today was also the per-batch Game Night for the new folks! 

### What I did
Looking at my GitHub history, not too much.

I'm starting to feel like I have hardly any time to get work done, but as I write this blog post I wonder how much of that is due to a lack of focus - I feel like I've lost some good habits about keeping myself immersed in my work.

In general, I've been spending a lot of time socializing with the new batch, as LS has been organizing coffee chats over the last few days. Coffee chats are, as the name might suggest, chats over coffee (though the coffee isn't mandatory) with someone you haven't yet had the opportunity to meet.

For some reason I'm also on the event committee! I'm really torn between devoting a lot of time to an event vs. spending more time on the programming side and just acting as general support. I think I'm leaning more towards focussing on programming, especially since I've felt really unproductive this last week.

We had an impromptu event-prep meeting for the Monday meet-and-code, another pair-programming workshop revolving around twists on some relatively simple problem (last time we did [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)). LS linked us to a list of programming problems on [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Programming_Tasks) but it felt like a lot of the tasks were more along the lines of interview preparation than something fun and simple a group can pair on within 15 minutes.

It turns out it's really hard to beat the Game of Life for both ease-of-access and general coolness.

Some actually approachable ideas we had were to implement a generalized [Vigen√®re cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher) and an [evolution of text program](http://usingpython.com/programs/#evolution).

Along the way, CW brought up [Weierstrass functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weierstrass_function) as a potential idea - it's a really cool function! He also showed off a Weierstrass function generator he built in the past, though it might not end up being approachable enough for us to use.

Soon afterwards, we had the regular Thursday presentations! Here's what people presented:

* ER presented a Tetris clone he'd written in C
* JLC did a really interesting introductory talk on [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog), noting some of its differences from typical programming languages (like how it's [declarative instead of imperative](https://tylermcginnis.com/imperative-vs-declarative-programming/)), as well as some simple use-cases
* AS did a talk on how to hack together a [Zulip](https://zulipchat.com/) clone using JavaScript and the Zulip API
* PC presented the backbone for this visual-delay webcam filter that projected images from the past given some user-input delay. He also mentioned[ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org/) - "zero configuration web application bundler". Though apparently, there is some configuration.
* LW showed off his [super hilarious NYC parks quiz](https://subject.space/parks/), in which the user is challenged to pick out the real NYC parks from the ones generated by a [recurrent neural network](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn) trained on the incredibly silly existing corpus of New York parks
* CW gave a characteristically hilarious talk on [Turing-completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness). Some things that are Turing-complete...
  * Microsoft Powerpoint and Microsoft Excel
  * The [Magic the Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en) card game - this is the one that made most sense to me, I mean, you do have [the stack](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Stack)...
  * Pokemon Yellow and Mario - apparently, you can abuse glitches to edit arbitrary memory locations!
  * Minesweeper - did you know you can create [logical gates in Minesweeper?](http://www.formauri.es/personal/pgimeno/compurec/Minesweeper.php)
* DP presented her one-week project of creating an animated cup of steaming-hot coffee in CSS
* CM gave her "My First Week" talk which she apparently gave in, well, her first week. The entire presentation was in [reaction gifs](https://giphy.com/categories/reactions), which was entirely hilarious

Finally, there was the classic RC Game Night! Free pizza, drinks, friends, and games.

I somehow got roped into a definitely wrong version of [Punderdome](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/202771/punderdome-card-game-pun-lovers), wherein I realized that despite a long high-school career of constant pun generation, I have suddenly lost my ability to create puns on short notice.

It's a sobering revelation.

Going from a barely-stitched together casual mess of a game to one of the most hardcore games I've played so far, AB introduced a group of us to [Agricola](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31260/agricola). It's been in my board game orbit for years but I have managed to avoid it until now. It actually went really well! Despite the staggering initial complexity, the game ends up being fairly intuitive and satisfying - however, like many of these games, it can be hard to maintain a clear picture of the board state without doing lots of mental arithmetic. I'm probably just bad at games.

Also, the game took over three hours.

### What I learned
* How to play [Agricola](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31260/agricola)
* The [Turing-completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) of some fairly odd things
* [Weierstrass functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weierstrass_function)!

### Interests/Stuff to work on
* Splendor in React!
* Code up Knapsack problem!
* CTF!
* [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/)
* Something in Prolog??
* PICO-8?
* Something with compilers? Maybe just the lexing and parsing side?
* Kubernetes!
* MongoDB!
