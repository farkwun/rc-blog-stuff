There was finally morning algorithm prep today, and I fully slept through it.

They even called me out by name on Zulip!

Not to worry, I'm "totally going to wake up on time tomorrow".

### General Thoughts
It was a very pair-y day today - first, I paired with KS on finally closing off on the awful, awful Problem Set 3 for the [MIT Algos course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/assignments/).

Afterwards, I had an extremely productive pairing session with LD on Splendor for React! I seriously got so much done, I'm feeling much better about the project.

We also had a movie night at RC!

### What I did
So the first half of the day was spent struggling with the given code for the MIT Problem Set. I'd tell you more about how it went, but to be honest I really didn't learn much of anything. The most valuable thing was probably just explaining my intuitions about binary trees and how to traverse them effectively - definitely something worth developing as a general skill, but not particularly exciting.

The only interesting thing I learned was that the [ncalls column in cProfile](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23018985/python-cprofile-results-two-numbers-for-ncalls) also tracked recursive calls, which I didn't expect.

Things only got juicy when I started pairing with LD. I learned so many odd JavaScript features, and JC walked me through [context binding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind) for class methods.

It turns out I've been using [arrow functions](https://www.sitepoint.com/es6-arrow-functions-new-fat-concise-syntax-javascript/) without really understanding the layers and layers of [syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar) that have been piled onto it.

I had no idea that arrow functions [automatically bind the generating context](https://medium.com/komenco/react-autobinding-2261a1092849), and I was really just blindly following patterns I'd seen in other tutorials.

Honestly, upon reflection, that [TicTacToe React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) was an excellent introduction - simple, approachable, while being embedded with lots of depth if you're looking for it. I feel bad for disparaging it!

The Splendor app is honestly getting to a point where I'm really going to have to start working up a back-end for it!

At movie night, we put a bunch of couches together and watched [Ghost in the Shell (1995)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113568/). I can see why it's considered a classic, and I was surprised to find details and choices that still felt innovative despite its age. 

However, that movie is super weird. I'm not sure I can really recommend it too strongly, as a lot of the cinematic shorthand that I've grown used to just wasn't present. I'm glad I saw it though!
