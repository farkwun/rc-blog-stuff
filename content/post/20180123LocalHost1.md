Blegh.

Day 2 of drug dependency was not nearly as fun as Day 1. Don't get me wrong, I still got a lot done, but the triumph was heavily colored by caffeinated sadness.

And I still didn't make it for morning interview prep! I'm a disaster.

### General Thoughts
Tuesday is a rare RC day where I have no immediate obligations - obviously that meant that I totally ignored all the courses and stuff I'm supposed to be doing and focussed on my own stuff instead.

Despite my best intentions, though, there were still a couple cool and distracting events.

I ended up completing the lions share of the Splendor busywork - all the components have been built, but I'm having serious project fatigue.

Well, I call it project fatigue, but its a lot more depression at how awful the front-end looks. I did my best, but I still have a terrible sense for the design part of all this - I have a mechanical understanding but not an aesthetic one.

I'm sure at least a part of it has to do with my unfamiliarity with CSS, but it feels really bad. I almost want to throw the project away, but that's probably a stupid idea.

### What I did
Aside from the majority of my time, which I spent on my awful, ugly React pile of trash, there were two pretty cool events.

The first was a [Zulip](https://zulipchat.com/) workshop led by AR - I thought we were going to focus more on creating bots, but the workshop actually ended up being a lot more about [contributing to the project](https://github.com/zulip/zulip) and getting set up.

As per classic code fashion, only one out of the ten of us in the room managed to get our environments working. At the end of it, AR (who's a pretty seasoned contributor) reached out to the Zulip team and got us all access to some pre-made [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) droplets! Awesome! Now we have a pretty solid dev environment if we want to try making some contributions. Setting up [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) was awful, especially because Zulip's guides were only set to work on Ubuntu - not that even the Ubuntu users in the room could get stuff working.

Maybe I'll try doing some work on a Zulip bot - might do for a break from my terrile JavaScript failures.

There was also a pretty interesting talk on [Xi](https://github.com/google/xi-editor), a "modern text editor" developed by Google Engineer Raph Levien
as part of the Recurse Center's [Localhost talks](https://www.recurse.com/localhost). It was held on the twenty-third floor of the beautiful [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com/) building. There were mad snacks.

The talk was really interesting, and a lot of it went over my head, but I was especially interested in the data structures Raph explored during his development of Xi - [ropes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(data_structure)) and [content-free replicated data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type). The most intriguing parts of the talk for me was his process for identifying bottlenecks within the system and his methodology for getting good data from his system.

He even set up his own little [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) circuit to simulate keyboard inputs and measuring time until monitor flash! Hacky but not something I would have ever thought of doing.

Also they had really good strawberries!

### What I learned
* The existence of two new data structures!
* Contributing to Zulip and a little bit about its contribution culture
* I am really bad at front-end

### Interests/Stuff to work on
* SHOW UP FOR MORNING ALGORITHM PREP
* Splendor in React!
* Putting together a more bare-bones neural net for Pytorch - fast.ai won't be there forever
* Rubocop for Metasploit
* Machine-learning client for Parallel Actors - STANDBY
* Problem Sets for the [MIT Algos course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/assignments/) - still with it so far
* [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/)
* Something in Prolog??
* PICO-8?
* Something with compilers? Maybe just the lexing and parsing side?
* Something in OCaml??
* SOMETHING FUNCTIONAL (programmatically and literally)
* Kubernetes!
* MongoDB!
