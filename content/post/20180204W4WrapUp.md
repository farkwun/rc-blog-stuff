title: "Week 4 Wrap Up!"

Every time I try to write one of these I have to double-check whether I write 'Week X' or 'WX' and whether I write 'Wrap-up' or 'Wrap Up'.

Can't I just be wildly inconsistent with my naming conventions, like every good programmer?

### Quick Weekend Thoughts
Bleh, I didn't do any RC stuff this weekend because I was too busy desperately trying to not be stone broke this week, considering my Canadian accounts got frozen (in their defense, it was probably a bad idea for me to change my account information then immediately start transferring thousands of dollars to unknown accounts) and my American accounts weren't accepting transfers.

As much as I've been trying to tout the advantages of spending the weekend sans programming, I actually think I might make a concerted effort to stop doing that. I just feel bad and out-of-sync with everything when I haven't been at RC for a couple of days.

Of course, it wouldn't be a weekend thoughts section without a brief note about doing my laundry and how ballin my room looks when I have everything neatly folded and put away.

I go hard on household living

### Major Thoughts
So this week probably hallmarks my first really positive week at RC. 

The first three weeks were characterized by a sudden and exhausting burst of energy, followed by a slowly increasing anxiety about not being where I needed to be in my development - I wouldn't say that that feeling has entirely gone away, but for some reason I've been feeling steadily more and more positive about my participation in the Recurse Center and the connections I've been making there.

That's not to say that there's any particular reason for the positivity - I'm pretty much broke, my project is far from done, and I still deleted my entire resume last week and haven't even begun to put the pieces back together.

Objectively, I should be freaking out even harder than before.

I think the big difference is that I've been having particularly positive social interactions with my batch-mates, either in the form of pairing sessions or just in affirmations of respect and friendliness, as well as making a ton of progress on my Splendor React project.

In fact, I'm happy to announce that the React front-end for [open-splendor](https://github.com/farkwun/open-splendor) is officially feature-complete!

However, it is **still a gigantic pile of hot garbage**. Functions are extremely long, inefficient, unreadable, and *there aren't any tests*. I realized recently that some people have actually clicked on the link to the project on my GitHub account and I have half a mind to go through all my previous blog posts and rip out the links, but I suppose the cat is likely out of the bag - it is **not ready for consumption**. 

My first task next week is a huge reformat. One of my friends linked me [PrettierJS](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) and [ALE](https://github.com/w0rp/ale) for use with [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) in order to help more strongly enforce my JavaScript styling, particularly alongside [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

I'm also somewhat relieved to find that we're finally skipping stuff in the [MIT Problem Sets](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/assignments/). This is probably mostly motivated by the Winter 1 batches ending in two weeks, prompting a more accelerated approach, but I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth.

That said, the MIT course did force me to take a more careful look into [generators](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/04/07/improve-your-python-yield-and-generators-explained/), so I can't throw too much shade.

Anyways, the major highlights this week were:
* Working on [Sharif CTF](http://ctf.sharif.edu/ctf8/) with the RC CTF team
* Checking out the fantastic [BBR](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2017/2/212428-bbr-congestion-based-congestion-control/fulltext#F1) talk at [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com/) and [Papers We Love](http://paperswelove.org/)
* Watching [Ghost in the Shell](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113568/), even if the movie was pretty weird
* **Pairing with LD and JLC on my Splendor app**! It was SO productive, despite the fact that it was probably negative value for them both

### Work Done
The Sharif CTF was amazing! I wish we had done the full 36 hour contest, and I would've been way more motivated to do it if the site hadn't crashed so early on.

I'm also really happy that all the front-end logic is more or less ready to go - I just need to figure out how I want to integrate it with my back-end. I can worry about that after the big reformat next week though. It's not going to be a trivial project, but I'm hoping I'll be able to move about it more fluently considering backend is a bit more in my wheelhouse.

### Big Lessons
I learned a *ton* about [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) fundamentals, and at least enough about JavaScript to be able to identify the disgusting [code smells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell) I've been embedding into the app.

Waking up on time is great! My two best days were arguably the days I was the most on time - not counting Friday which would have been an unmitigated disaster if not for the CTF in which I got to participate.

I also am syncing a lot harder with what JK was saying about being okay with letting things fall to the wayside if they aren't that interesting. [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/) has been great, and to a certain extent so has the MIT course, but I'm starting to withdraw a little bit from both of those commitments and restrict the amount of time I spend on them to a more reasonable level.

### Next Week Goals
Okay, seriously, present!

I'm presenting next week.

I'M PRESENTING NEXT WEEK.

**I'M PRESENTING NEXT WEEK.**

Also, in broader terms, finish the Big Reformat and start designing a database schema for Splendor.

### Interests/Stuff to work on
* Splendor in React!
* Morning Golang prep!
* Even more CTF!
* Look into rope series and CRDTs
* Problem Sets for the [MIT Algos course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/assignments/)
* [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/)
* Something in Prolog??
* PICO-8?
* Something with compilers? Maybe just the lexing and parsing side?
* Something in OCaml??
* SOMETHING FUNCTIONAL (programmatically and literally)
* Kubernetes!
* MongoDB!
