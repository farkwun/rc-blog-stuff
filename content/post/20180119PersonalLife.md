I'm technically writing this on Saturday, as I was too busy checking out [the Beyond Burger](http://beyondmeat.com/products/view/beyond-burger) and just generally cramming my body full of unnecessary calories to blog, but it should still say this was published yesterday.

Nefarious!

I guess it's good that this is also going to be a really sparse post, considering how late and low-quality it already is by default.

### General Thoughts
RC closed early yesterday (I'm writing this on Saturday, remember!) due to a scheduled power outage, which wouldn't have been too bad except I also spent the entire morning doing personal, non-RC related errands. I'm kind of glad that I was forced to take an early rest for Friday and Saturday. I think I want to spend at least one day a week doing nothing at all coding-related.

As has become a theme for these posts, the day was incredibly unproductive, but I did go over the second half of [Problem Set 2](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/assignments/MIT6_006F11_ps2.pdf) for the [MIT Algos course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/assignments/).

### What I did
So the rest of the problem set ended up being really, really easy (though I imagine it would be tough if I was looking at it for the first time ever).The problem basically boiled down to sussing out that you needed to use a [priority queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue) to resolve a bottleneck in a provided module.

The MIT problem set specifically said not to import any additional libraries - just my luck that the standard library had already been imported and there was nothing in the set about *importing additional modules...* - I did an [import heapq](https://docs.python.org/2/library/heapq.html) and called it a day.

The rest of the group thought that would probably net me a zero if I were enrolled in the actual course, and we spent much of the rest of the session discussing how to [implement our own binary heap from scratch in Python](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/Trees/BinaryHeapImplementation.html).

I find [heaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)) interesting, performant, and an unexpectedly common interview pattern - definitely a data structure worth reviewing.

I also did more work on my Splendor front-end - I'm starting to write out all the components with dummy data and twiddling with the CSS. I'm still nowhere near functionality though. I've been thinking about it, and this project might actually take up the entire batch length - I really hope it doesn't though.

### What I learned
* The Beyond Burger is solid but not life-changing

### Interests/Stuff to work on
* Splendor in React!
* SHOW UP FOR MORNING ALGORITHM PREP
* Putting together a more bare-bones neural net for Pytorch - fast.ai won't be there forever
* Rubocop for Metasploit
* Machine-learning client for Parallel Actors - STANDBY
* Problem Sets for the [MIT Algos course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/assignments/) - still with it so far
* [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/)
* Something in Prolog??
* PICO-8?
* Something with compilers? Maybe just the lexing and parsing side?
* Something in OCaml??
* SOMETHING FUNCTIONAL (programmatically and literally)
* Kubernetes!
* MongoDB!
