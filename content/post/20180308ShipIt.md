I hate waking up so incredibly late!

It's awful!

Also my boots were still wet from yesterday!

Life is suffering!

### General Thoughts
I only got in 45 minutes before the post-lunch prep session was supposed to start and, in general, that leaves me super stressed out.

There's also a pretty major worry that I'm just introducing stress into the space through these questions.

I'm starting to wonder if I'm handling this post-lunch prep in some particularly wrong-headed way. Is it as accessible as it could be? Are there structures we can build at RC to empower the least experienced to pursue interview prep in a meaningful and fulfilling way?

I dunno. I certainly don't feel like I'm doing a good job of it.

### What I did
Today's post-lunch prep was on [binary trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree).

The questions were: 

1. https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/
2. https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/description/

I think the second question was still too hard, as it didn't seem like anybody came up with a good solution by the end of the hour, but there were far fewer complaints so maybe it's all good.

There were demos today instead of presentations!

I have officially shipped a disastrously bad alpha of [open-splendor](https://github.com/farkwun/open-splendor). Check it out [here](https://splendor.bryan-chu.com/).

I didn't get to see many demos, as I was demoing myself, but I was particularly taken with BL's implemention of a [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) health checker that checks if your DNS configuration is set up correctly.

Today was also the brainstorming workshop for the interactive art jam coming up on Sunday!

Brainstorming was really fun. Two ideas we came up with:

1) A projector pointed towards a staircase that slowly displays lines of a poem as you go up the stairs
2) A webcam that identifies humans, assigns them an ID and a snippet of music, and creates melodies as people interact

I'm feeling really down. I feel like open-splendor sucks a lot, looks awful, and I hate the disgusting [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) back-end more and more each day.

I have half a mind to take it down, if any more bugs start showing up - it truly is unbelievably unmaintainable.
