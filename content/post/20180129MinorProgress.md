I'm trying my best not to fill this brief pre-section with endless banalities about how late I woke up or whether I did my laundry.

For your information, extremely late, and hell yeah I did.

Oops.

### General Thoughts
I finally got to have that big conversation with JC about [React](https://reactjs.org/) and JavaScript.

He walked me through some programming concepts he felt would be really helpful, like [higher-order functions](https://www.sitepoint.com/higher-order-functions-javascript/) and some general functional programming fundamentals, like [pure functions](https://www.sitepoint.com/functional-programming-pure-functions/). He also showed off some cool [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) functions like [compose](https://redux.js.org/docs/api/compose.html) and walked me through a simple implementation of a [throttle](https://medium.com/@_jh3y/throttling-and-debouncing-in-javascript-b01cad5c8edf).

That said, a lot of the conversation was abstract and primarily useful in an academic sense. Maybe something to be kept in mind down the line.

### What I did
The morning was spent going through Lesson 3 of the [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/) course, which was just a re-iteration of the Notebook 1 stuff! A bit of a waste of time - I should've watched it at 3x speed or something.

There was a meetup today to discuss the work we'd been doing for fast.ai, and it looks like most of us are stuck on the [leaf classifier](https://www.kaggle.com/c/leaf-classification), since there's more at play there than just simple image recognition - we're only given 10 training images for each species, and a wealth of other structured data. In theory Lesson 4 promises to go over neural nets for that kind of data input. I have a sinking feeling that it won't though.

I also finally started plugging in the logic for Splendor - I think I'm really going to do my best to have something substantial by Thursday!

Despite my better judgment, LW came by and [nerd-sniped](https://xkcd.com/356/) me into doing some more work on the MIT problem set. I'm supposed to do some work with KS on it tomorrow, but I worry it won't be that high value.

### What I learned
* Intro to functional programming!

### Interests/Stuff to work on
* More CTF for sure!
* Look into rope series and CRDTs
* SHOW UP FOR MORNING ALGORITHM PREP
* Splendor in React!
* Putting together a more bare-bones neural net for Pytorch
* Rubocop for Metasploit
* Machine-learning client for Parallel Actors - STANDBY
* Problem Sets for the [MIT Algos course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/assignments/)
* [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/)
* Something in Prolog??
* PICO-8?
* Something with compilers? Maybe just the lexing and parsing side?
* Something in OCaml??
* SOMETHING FUNCTIONAL (programmatically and literally)
* Kubernetes!
* MongoDB!
