I was debating with myself whether to do weekly Sunday RC wrap-ups or just be lazy and do nothing and I guess the Sunday thing won out even though I can't really remember how I could've possibly let that happen.

Welcome to the Bryan Chu RC Blog Week 1 Wrap-up, where I'll dish on the stuff I worked on, the thoughts I had, and what my outlook is going to be onthe coming week. I'll try to keep complaining to a minimum but no guarantees.

### Quick Weekend Thoughts
So the majority of my weekend was dominated by doing laundry and sleeping almost all of Saturday, but I went into RC today even though it wasn't an official day. 

While there, I met STT who was an old alum and was an actor and playwright before coming to RC! I thought that was really awesome, and I had a lot of fun talking to him about his journey to programming. He recommended a [JavaScript book by Jon Duckett](https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-JQuery-Interactive-Front-End-Development/dp/1118531647) that I'm excited to check out.

I also got to talk database design with HY, a front-end dev working on medical procedure checklist software. It was a really great conversation, but ultimately boiled down to my massive unfamiliarity with [non-relational databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL). I'm really interested in MongoDB and how to approach data queries without using relational structures - neither of us seem to have a good handle on the way it's supposed to work. She's a really experienced React dev though and she was talking me through [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - I think my project next week is going to use a JS front-end framework.

On a non-programming standpoint, I checked out [TY's blog](http://tobin.yehle.io/pottery) and, though I'm sure it has some great technical merits, I was blown away by his beautiful [pottery](http://tobin.yehle.io/pottery).

As an aside, I got [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) working on the community cluster, and I'm excited to dive into [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/) tomorrow. 

I worked through the [Tic-Tac-Toe React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) which was interesting but too shallow. I'm going to try looking for better resources.

I also spent like 3 hours trying to install React on my DigitalOcean droplet. Good stuff.

### Major Thoughts
It's probably no surprise that the past week was dominated by the people I met and the interactions I had with them. The most notable interactions that come to mind are:

* Talking to SH about Kubernetes and Docker
* Prolog with JF
* Checking out AM's unbelievably sick PICO-8 game
* Playing board games with everyone! I was talking with TY about this today, and both of us were so surprised at how sharp RCers are, even and especially when they're completely new to the game. Playing [Avalon](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128882/resistance-avalon) with new people is usually a disaster, but not with people like these.

I also really liked seeing everybody's presentations, especially [Slow-HN](https://www.slow-hn.com/) and MIDI Markov Chain music generation.

There's been a bit of a theme throughout the week about emergent complexity from the combination of simple elementary components. That started with [nand2tetris](http://nand2tetris.org/) but I think I've been seeing it pop up here and there. In general, the effect is that I've started to feel like a lot more things are possible or within my grasp as a developer and engineer, but maybe that will start fading as I get pummeled by more and more projects.

### Work Done
Speaking of getting pummeled, the work I did on my [evolutionary neural net for ParallelActors](https://github.com/farkwun/ParallelActors/tree/evolutionary_nn_client) was deeeeeply unrewarding. I technically got an evolutionary model implemented but it is straight up terrible - I know the next step is going to include spawning independent processes to parallelize trials, but I don't have the heart to work on it right now. I'm going to try to put it on the back-burner for the next week.

While I enjoyed the MIT algorithms course, I worry that it's ultimately not going to be entirely relevant to the things I want to accomplish at RC. As an intellectual exercise, I think it would be incredibly worthwhile to go through the problem sets, but looking forward I'm uncertain as to their future utility. There's a daily morning interview question practice in Golang - I'm going to see if that's more aligned to my goals, particularly with interviews.

I'm nervous about [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/), but I'm also kind of excited. I'm all set up to do a deep dive on it next week, and I expect to be able to get a lot done. 

### Big Lessons
Ooof, I don't even know why I put this section in here. I feel like I didn't learn that much, other than that evolution as a machine learning model is really slow and hard to get right.

In general, I'm starting to see what RCers talk about when they mention how empowering they found the space - the community here is really strong and I'm honestly astounded at how intelligent, methodical, friendly, and talented the people here are. 

For some reason, I had this impression that most of the people I would run into at RC would be newbies or also just getting started with programming. Maybe because I got in, and that's what **I** am. But, the more I talk to people and get a sense for their projects, the more I realize that the vast majority of RCers are deeply talented, disciplined, mature engineers and developers with serious domain knowledge. People like me are definitely in the minority.

### Next Week Goals
I am really, really motivated to work on some front-end stuff. It's maybe not as sexy or bleeding-edge like some of the other stuff is at RC, and I worry that the project I chose is kind of dumb, but I think it's going to be really critical for my development as an engineer.

Talking to some of the other programmers at RC, I feel like I'm so close to being able to fully realize apps and ideas from the database to the UX. I've got a handle on all these parts of the stack, but the user-facing parts are a complete mystery. If I can just get a good understanding of front-end design and a front-end framework, I feel like I'll be able to accomplish a lot.

I also want to do all of the first part of the [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/) course. Hopefully I can get that done tomorrow.

### Interests/Stuff to work on

* [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/)
* Something in Prolog??
* PICO-8?
* Something with compilers? Maybe just the lexing and parsing side?
* Something in OCaml??
* SOMETHING FUNCTIONAL (programmatically and literally)
* Kubernetes!
