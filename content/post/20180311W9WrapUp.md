Daylight Savings Time!

I am so sleepy, though that probably has more to do with general bad habits than anything specific.

It felt so sunny today!

I totally changed my mind about daylight savings today when it was 5PM and still nice and bright outside.

### Quarterly Review

So [open-splendor is finally up and running](https://splendor.bryan-chu.com/), and at this point it's not even that riddled with bugs.

I should be happy, but I can't quite shake the feeling that I wasted my last 9 weeks here at RC.

It's nice to have something that is technically shipped, but it does really feel like a massive waste of time. Did I really do something cool, or was it just a gigantic boring piece of garbage?

It kind of feels like the latter.

I can't say I haven't learned a lot. Along the way I've learned [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [middleware](https://redux.js.org/advanced/middleware), and a solid chunk of [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), but somehow it all seems so trivial and lame.

I guess this quarterly review isn't that positive.

I've been super procrastinating on [Golang](https://golang.org/) and [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) too!

The big question for me right now is whether or not I'm ultimately going to extend my batch. Going into the last Quarterly Review I was pretty sure I would, but for some reason I'm less sure.

It could be that I'm being totally kicked out of my place on April 1st - it's as good a reason as any to just leave NYC.

I think part of the reason is that I recently feel like I've been stagnating - maybe it's because [open-splendor](https://github.com/farkwun/open-splendor) has been mostly non-fulfilling over the last week, but I do really want to get it finished.

Honestly, I've been trying to parse my emotions over the last week on extending vs just leaving, and it's been really hard for me to figure out exactly what I'm feeling. For some reason, the prospect of another six weeks at the Recurse Center just doesn't seem that attractive, and maybe a part of that is due to something I'm missing in my life at RC? I really have nothing to go on here.

I suppose I'll find out if there's anything in Toronto that can fill that gap, as I'm heading back up to Canada this Wednesday to see a performance of one of my plays.

### Quick Weekend Thoughts
This weekend was pretty boring!

I had a super great laundry day on Saturday, as per usual, and I think that was probably the peak of the week for me.

The interactive art jam got moved to Monday, but LW and I still showed up on Sunday just in case anybody wanted to keep working.

Nobody showed up.

It was all for the best, though, as LW and I got to pair more on his React project, [Conceptquest](https://github.com/loganwilliams/conceptquest), which is an interactive adventure built using data from the [ConceptNet](http://conceptnet.io/) API - a supremely cool knowledge graph that allows you to find all kinds of wonderful and weird connections between any given topic. I got to introduce him to [variable destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) and [partial application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application).

In return, LW walked me through [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) an *incredible* [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html) layout type that is helping me remove all kinds of weird and gross habits I've embedded into open-splendor.

If anything, I'm feeling a little more positive about RC after learning a bunch of cool CSS tricks from LW, but then again during our conversation I realized I had actually architected most of my CSS completely wrong in the first place, so there are definitely some mixed feelings.

### Major Thoughts
Today was an odd week.

I actually shipped [open-splendor](https://github.com/farkwun/open-splendor), and I honestly wasn't sure that would ever happen. That said, it's a very sub-optimal shipping. Major back-end features, like connecting to a Postgres database, back-end validation, and just even making a server in Golang, are all completely missing. That also meant that the back-end was pretty broken and barely functional the whole week, which just does not feel great.

In general, my viewpoint towards RC has been steadily getting more and more depressed - I don't really feel like I'm making a lot of progress or learning anything super cool anymore, and I'm finding myself re-treading old negative self-ideation habits.

Bleh.

The major highlights this week were:
* Shipping the god-awful [open-splendor](https://github.com/farkwun/open-splendor)
* Death by Audio arcade demos!
* Afternoon tea with a bunch of RCers

### Work Done
There were seriously a ton of commits this week.

I basically got open-splendor to a working level, and I even demoed my project!

There was also a ton of pairing on React, which was cool just because I got to show off some of my favourite language features and provide value to others.

Speaking of providing value to others, I also did a lot of post-lunch prep stuff! It was pretty cool, even if I kind of feel bad and stressed out about the whole thing.

This week we covered:

* Strings
* Linked lists
* Binary search
* Binary trees
* Recursion

That's a lot of topics!

I also feel oddly disconnected to my peers at RC, as if I'm not making any genuine connections. I'm not sure why that is, but I'm going to make an effort to build some more meaningful relationships and be more open in general.

### Big Lessons

I'm honestly not too sure.

I think the big lesson might well be that as fun as it is writing garbage server code it really does come back to bite you pretty hard. [Splendor](https://splendor.bryan-chu.com/) has crashed a lot.

### Next Week Goals
Get a simple example [Golang](https://golang.org/) server API running.

Do some cool interactive art!
