title: "Week 7 Wrap Up!"

Once again I am here writing the weekly wrap up on Monday instead of when I was actually supposed to.

I need to figure out a way to ensure I actually write these on Sunday instead of letting the blog lyfe bleed into my actual RC life.

### Quick Weekend Thoughts
I must have spent the entire Saturday asleep! I felt especially bad because I ended up sleeping through an invitation to do some interview prep at an RCer's place. Bleh!

Of course, the big highlight this weekend was getting all my laundry done and folding it all neatly away into their respective and proper plaecs. It still hasn't quite gotten old, though I suspect much of the satisfcation came from being literally out of clothes by the time laundry day rolled around.

Sunday was spent walking through Central Park and eating a truly unwise volume of food, none of which was actually particularly good.

I didn't even get as much sleep as I wanted!

I did end up going into RC where I had an illuminating conversation with JLC about the [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), specifically about the nature of [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises) and the the specific internals of the fetch-then-then-catch pattern.

Also, I had a simultaneously fascinating and deeply worrying conversation about having to go in and out of Canada in March - I might get stopped at the border and barred from re-entering the US. That would be a disaster.

### Major Thoughts
I feel really, really unhappy that I'm writing this blog on Monday instead of Sunday - I strongly feel that this gives a bad taste to the week just like waking up late does. I don't ever want to do this again, but let's see if I can make good on that promise. 

Basically, this week was entirely social and I got almost nothing done at all on anything. I actually feel awful this week.

On the one hand, I more or less committed myself to doing mostly social stuff all week, but it still doesn't feel good.

I've been really worried that I've engendered a bunch of really bad habits into myself when it comes to work - pace on [open-splendor](https://github.com/farkwun/open-splendor) has become postively glacial, and there's no reason for that other than my own slothfulness.

I've noticed I've been more and more distracted this week, and the result of that is that I'm not coding and I'm not progressing. How can I STILL be working on open-splendor? It's time to put this project down and push something out even if its awful.

The major highlights this week were:

* Meeting a ton of cool new batch people!
* Occult Working Group
* Playing [Agricola](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31260/agricola) for hours and hours
* Figuring out an entire [PSET ](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/assignments/MIT6_006F11_ps5.pdf) by the seat of our pants with LW
* FINALLY understanding Level03 of the [Live CD CTF](http://www.janosgyerik.com/hacking-contest-on-a-live-cd/)

### Work Done
Almost nothing?

Feels really bad.

### Big Lessons
I need to focus.

My current progress is unacceptable.

I've also been avoiding joining a new course, but I think that's alienating me from the new batch. However, if I want to join a course, I'm really going to need to get my shit together.

### Next Week Goals
Throw this project together. Make it dirty. Who cares. I need to get moving, and move on with my life.

### Interests/Stuff to work on
* Splendor in React!
* [MIT OS course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-828-operating-system-engineering-fall-2012/)
* Code up Knapsack problem!
* CTF!
* [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/)
* Something in Prolog??
* PICO-8?
* Something with compilers? Maybe just the lexing and parsing side?
* Kubernetes!
* MongoDB!
