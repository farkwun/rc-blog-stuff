I got totally distracted last night by [open-splendor](https://github.com/farkwun/open-splendor) so I held off on blogging until Saturday.

In general, though, I've been having trouble figuring out what to talk about after all these weeks - I feel like the things I'm doing are less and less remarkable or notable.

As if they ever were.

### General Thoughts
Today was pretty solid, but not really that great in terms of my own development.

I spent most of the day pairing on projects with cool people, which was fun, or roaming about New York attending sick events and eating ridiculous amounts of food.

All those activities were ballin but not particularly productive.

### What I did
I actually got in at 10:45 AM in order to pair with LW on his amazing project, Conceptquest, which I'll put up a link to as soon as its ready to go.

Conceptquest is also written in [React](https://reactjs.org/), and it was pretty cool pairing on it with him. We mostly refactored his code to better take advantage of [arrow functions](https://www.sitepoint.com/es6-arrow-functions-new-fat-concise-syntax-javascript/) and [spread operators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/scripting/javascript/reference/spread-operator-decrement-dot-dot-dot-javascript).

Today's post-lunch prep topic was [recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion). The questions we did today were:

1. https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/
2. https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/

In regards to open-splendor, I've been tweaking the experience here or there and just generally trying to improve the quality of play. I've been doing my best to keep the deployed version up-to-date with the latest changes, so you should feel free to check it out anytime at https://splendor.bryan-chu.com/

Now that I'm in polish mode, it's pretty satisfying fixing old gross code idiosyncracies that I've been letting fall by the way side for the last many weeks. The actual visual design is still complete garbage though.

I also finally attended a session of the [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](https://geneticmail.com/scott/library/text/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks_p1_0.pdf) study group! We discussed [Io](http://iolanguage.org/), a pretty fascinating [prototype-based language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming) like [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). 

The language seems very interesting, but as I attended having done zero prep work I didn't get as much out of it as I should've.

In terms of events, I got to check out [bitforms](http://www.bitforms.com/), a gallery for digital art! There was an exhibit there by [Tristan Perich](http://www.tristanperich.com/) called [Noise Patterns](http://www.bitforms.com/exhibitions/perich-2018), a selection of machine drawings using a sharpie, a wall, and what looks like random noise.

The end result was actually pretty visually appealing, and two of the pieces were being live-drawn in the space (inasmuch as a machine is alive)!

Afterwards, we went to an amazing demo night from the [Death by Audio arcade](http://deathbyaudioarcade.com/) indie game group hosted at [Cloud City](http://www.cloudcity.nyc/), an art space in Williamsburg.

Of course, the reason we went was to check out AM's new game. AM was the inimitable creator of [Just One Boss](https://brid.gs/games/just-one-boss), and has reprised her awesome game with another - [Juggle Panic](https://brid.gs/games/juggle-panic).

Just One Boss was incredible, and Juggle Panic was an absolute blast! All of AM's games are super polished and hilarious.
