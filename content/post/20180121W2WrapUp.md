Two weeks at RC! Looks like these weekend wrap-ups are going to be a thing from now on.

### Quick Weekend Thoughts
It wouldn't be a Bryan Chu weekend without a good laundry and house-keeping experience, and this weekend really delivered. I got a ton of laundry done and I also cleaned up my room. I know this is the kind of content that keeps readers coming back for more and more.

Despite my inclination, I was somehow convinced into checking out Times Square, specifically cheesecake at [Junior's](https://www.juniorscheesecake.com/). I honestly don't know if I would've gone without the promise of food.

I've been on a bit of a crusade against cheesecake for a couple of years, but Junior's cheesecake officially made me a convert. It was sooo delicious, as much as it pains me to admit.

I also couldn't resist trying out the [Impossible Burger](https://www.impossiblefoods.com/burger/) - I much preferred it to the [Beyond Burger](http://beyondmeat.com/products/view/beyond-burger). It was super meaty!

Finally, I stayed up way too late at a friend's playing [One Night Ultimate Werewolf](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/147949/one-night-ultimate-werewolf), a twist on the classic [Werewolf](https://www.playwerewolf.co/rules/). I'm a huge fan of its much faster iteration time and silliness, but I'm pretty sure we lost every single game.

In case it wasn't obvious, I did absolutely nothing programming related all weekend. Is that a good thing? I'm not certain.

### Major Thoughts
RC is definitely settling down but I feel like I'm not making any real progress. It's cool doing all these courses and interacting with people, but I also feel like I'm doing a bad job getting the most out of my experience. 

Specifically, this React Splendor project is cool but I do feel like I'm not doing a great job of utilizing RC's resources or managing my time effectively. I think I'm going to try to either make a bigger push on the React stuff or pick up a smaller project to toy around with. We'll see!

The major highlights this week were:
* Checking out [NYC Resistor](https://www.nycresistor.com/)
* Getting my mind blown with CSS
* [Group Theory Colouring](http://www.coloring-book.co/) Workshop

### Work Done
It feels like the only work I'm actually getting done is course-related.

All of last week was dominated by [MIT Algos](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/assignments/) and [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/).

I'm not really happy with my progress. I talked to KS who mentioned that she feels that she's done a lot, and it doesn't make sense for me to feel like I'm not doing anything as she's doing all the stuff I'm doing. 

It's a convincing argument. 

### Big Lessons
No big revelations here - I'm starting to get a sense for what I want out of this experience though, and maybe that's enough.

It's especially frustrating to me that I keep being plagued by this sense of suboptimality. Every day I feel like I leave RC feeling crappy about not having achieved enough, or being really burnt out after a particularly involved study group meeting.

I started toying around with making sure things stayed on track.

Maybe I'm setting unrealistic expectations for myself. Something to think about.

### Next Week Goals
Be happy with what I'm working on!

Either find a satisfactory level of progress or drop the project and find something else.

### Interests/Stuff to work on
* Splendor in React!
* SHOW UP FOR MORNING ALGORITHM PREP
* Putting together a more bare-bones neural net for Pytorch - fast.ai won't be there forever
* Rubocop for Metasploit
* Machine-learning client for Parallel Actors - STANDBY
* Problem Sets for the [MIT Algos course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/assignments/) - still with it so far
* [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/)
* Something in Prolog??
* PICO-8?
* Something with compilers? Maybe just the lexing and parsing side?
* Something in OCaml??
* SOMETHING FUNCTIONAL (programmatically and literally)
* Kubernetes!
* MongoDB!
