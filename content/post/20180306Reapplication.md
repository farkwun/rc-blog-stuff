Blurrgh.

Every time I have a late evening it feels super not worth it.

I tried to just embrace my weak human need to sleep today, and intentionally allowed myself to sleep in.

I still felt super guilty about it!

### General Thoughts
I've been finding it really tough lately trying to figure out what to write about in these blog posts.

On the one hand, it might be because I'm learning less, and that's probably objectively true - what with running this new daily post-lunch prep event and focussing a lot more on [open-splendor](https://github.com/farkwun/open-splendor), I've been feeling less and less like I'm exploring new stuff, even if I'm making significant steps towards my goals.

Oh well. I never promised these posts would be interesting.

### What I did
At this point, I haven't done any course work at all for weeks, and damn does it feel good.

Today's post-lunch prep was on [linked lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list). We tried having two questions this time, and it was way more successful!

Take a look at the [introductory question](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/description/) and [somewhat more involved question](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/) if you have an interest.

It seems like we're still finding our footing as to how exactly we want to proceed, but so far things have been improving every time. I think there's still a huge issue when it comes to accessibility, and what I find is that the people who probably need help the most are least willing to vocalize their needs.

I'm not certain there's a good way to solve the problem - some RCers are questioning the focus I've been placing on pairing, as interview prep is definitely a more solitary endeavour than some other RC projects. I really want to timebox post-interview prep super hard though - people aren't at RC to grind [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) problems!

I get that most everyone has this idea of interview prep as solitary and painful, but I have to say that, in my experience, the amount of progress you can make in interview prep with a deliberate mentor or partner is so much better value for time.

We'll see how it all shakes out though.

After post-lunch prep, I spent the entire day building open-splendor up to a point where it's almost ready-for-play.

At time of writing, the only features left to resolve are end-game condition checking (right now you kind of just play forever), some sort of game over screen, and actually serving the bundle from the server.

Of course, there are still a ton of things to figure out server-side, but ideally I get this all ready to go by demo day this Thursday (it might not even be demo day... maybe it's just a weird rumour).

I also went to see AK's talk at [MVR](https://pioneerworks.org/programs/mvr-3-2/) about her blood batteries. I must have heard different variations on this talk three times by now, but I'm still getting different stuff out of it every time. 

We talked with AK afterwards about her process - using heated water to mix gelatin first so as not to overheat the blood when creating blood jelly (as an electrolyte for the battery), blood jelly getting melted by curing resin, and more.

### What I learned
* Resin heats up when its curing!
* I am possibly not learning stuff

### Interests/Stuff to work on

* [MIT OS course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-828-operating-system-engineering-fall-2012/)
* Code up Knapsack problem!
* CTF!
* [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/)
* Something in Prolog??
* PICO-8?
* Something with compilers? Maybe just the lexing and parsing side?
* Kubernetes!
* MongoDB!
