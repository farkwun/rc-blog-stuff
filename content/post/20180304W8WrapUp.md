title: "Week 8 Wrap Up"

I finished the first draft of my application to extend at RC this weekend.

The more I think about it recently the more I think I might be interested in heading back to Toronto after all - my landlady is kicking me out of my place end of March, and I have to go back and forth from New York to Canada two weekends in a row. That's not strictly relevant to extending, it's just additional stress around my location and living arrangements.

It sounds like the facilitators think I should just stay in Canada for a week instead of transiting back and forth, in order to minimize my interactions with border security - I can totally see their point, but I really don't want to miss a whole week of RC.

I super want to just gamble, but it's not a very methodical decision.

A part of me wants to just offload the decision to my application - if I don't get to extend, I think it's absolutely worth gambling.

I guess we'll see!

### Quick Weekend Thoughts
This weekend was fantastic! It was chock-full of adventure, even if not all too much sleep.

Saturday was the classic Bryan Chu laundry day, and I can never be too unhappy with a good laundry day.

The highlight, though, was the big Sunday hiking trip in [Harriman State Park](https://parks.ny.gov/parks/145)! After weeks and weeks in the all-concrete environment of New York, it was really incredible getting to spend so much time in nature, even if my boots are now entirely soaked.

I also woke up earlier than I've woken up in months, so hopefully this is the beginning of a whole new saga of good sleep schedules - seems pretty unlikely, as I'm writing this at 3:40 AM.

### Major Thoughts
I think the overall negative bent of my wrap-up last week really helped motivate me this week.

I've made a super substantial chunk of progress on [open-splendor](https://github.com/farkwun/open-splendor), and I think it's pretty likely that I'll be able to move all-in on [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) design and database stuff next week.

As silly as it might sound, data entry was super great on Friday, even if I stayed at RC until like 6 AM. It's such a small, trivial, mundane task, but it actually resolved a considerable amount of internal stress regarding certain aspects of the application.

I'm really excited to jump straight into [Golang](https://golang.org/) and [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) next week, though there are still a couple of features I need to close out in the front-end.

The major highlights this week were:
* Data entry
* [Occult Working Group](https://occult.bryan-chu.com/ana/)
* Premature optimization and [sorting networks](http://pages.ripco.net/~jgamble/nw.html)
* Hiking!

### Work Done

It feels like I got a lot of work done, though objectively it probably isn't all that true.

I've felt a lot better at staying focussed and following through on my commitments, particularly blogging-related, so it might just be a function of life outlook.

That said, I *did* totally convert all the Splendor resources into a usable format on Friday, and that came with a huge surge of productivity. I resolved a ton of weird technical issues I wasn't quite sure how to solve that night, and I think that that really helped me feel a lot better about the project.

I also really enjoyed that premature optimization session - I've been raving about it for three blog posts straight, so I'll do my best to lay off it next week. Still, it's probably going to be one of my more memorable RC experiences.

LW and I put together a plan for the interactive art jam we wanted to hold next week, and I'm also starting my own small, regular event at RC every day next week. 

Should be exciting!

Finally, as much as it's not very fun or sexy, helping interview for interview prep was oddly fulfilling - I hope it's not just a feeling and is actually providing some amount of value, of course.

### Big Lessons

I'm not sure if there were any big personal lessons, other than to take the time out each day to make progress.

Many weeks ago, JK told me to timebox my own personal project work, and I think there's value in that approach still. I think I could be doing a much better job each day organizing my schedule and ensuring I'm making the progress I need to.

That said, I also think that spontaneous silly projects have become a continuing source of joy for me here at RC.

If there's a lesson to be learned, it might be just that progress is worthwhile even if you have to write a bunch of gross code in order to do it. I think my [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) mock server is the grossest code I've written at RC (not counting any weird hacked together CSS animations), but even writing gross functional code can be surprisingly enjoyable.

It's always nice to burn everything down and just do whatever you want.

### Next Week Goals
Get to [Go](https://golang.org/)!

I can do it. There are only a couple more [thunks](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) I need to write and some more small validation rules before I can completely abandon this stupid front-end and go all-in on API and database design.

Also, I don't want to miss the [Io](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_(programming_language)) discussion next week! I better make sure I make it to that, too.
