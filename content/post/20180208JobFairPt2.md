The lasting effects of sleep deprivation continue, as I rolled in today at a record-shattering 12:40 PM.

I'm also developing really bad habits on the other end, as I'm writing this at 3:26 AM!

I imagine this is totally maintainable and won't have any negative consequences.

### General Thoughts
As Thursday is typically the last official RC day, this day marks the end of the 5th week of RC!

It doesn't feel like it's been that long, but by this time next week the Winter 1 batch will be officially [never graduated](https://www.recurse.com/). That also means that I'm nearly halfway done!

I've been seriously entertaining thoughts of extending my batch an extra six weeks, mostly because it's not like I'd be doing anything at home anyways. I'll decide when I'm at the halfway point!

It should come as no surprise that I also totally didn't present - it sounds awful, but I think I may well have spent this entire week refactoring [open-splendor](https://github.com/farkwun/open-splendor). I was all excited to present this week, but I didn't end up finishing my refactoring until 5 minutes before presentations started - hardly a good time to stress-test your demo in front of a roomful of people.

Maybe next time (as if).

The sleepiness is having serious consequences on my ability to work effectively, even if I'm having a really great time socializing with my batchmates.

In general, though, I'm starting to feel really anxious about the project I chose. I'm having a lot of fun learning React and building out a functional front-end, but I'm starting to get really worried the project is a huge waste of time. Even when I describe it to my other batchmates it sounds like a really stupid idea. Maybe if the game I was writing was original, it might be more novel, but re-implementing an [existing board game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148228/splendor) seems somewhat idiotic.

I suppose I'll get it working and see how I feel about it. Even if the project itself sucks, I'm learning a lot, but it burns when I look at the exciting stuff everybody else is building.

### What I did
I finally finished off the Big Refactor that was promised last weekend, even though it took me three more days than I'd like.

The morning I devoted to polishing off the big changes to my data model and ensuring functionality was maintained - I'm really feeling the burn of not having written tests! I talked to JC about it and he mentioned I might want to try moving everything into [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) before writing any though.

I also fully committed to not being up to speed on [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/) - I came to the meeting, and it sounds like everyone is still working through the videos. I'm okay with taking it slow on the fast.ai stuff, especially if it means I can make more progress on my app.

Of course, only after completing the initially-scoped refactor did I start crunching through all my [linting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) errors - turns out [ALE](https://github.com/w0rp/ale) was letting my linter fail silently in the background, and what I had taken to be a complete lack of linting errors was really just a lack of any linter at all. Serves me right.

I got it working last night and was both gratified and deeply displeased to see the massive amount of stylistic errors I'd been making throughout my entire project.

For one thing, all of my variable names were in [snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) (I blame [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#descriptive-naming-styles)) instead of [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) - but this was the least of my worries.

I also had a somewhat mystifying error about missing prop validation... which led me to implementing [PropTypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) only **after** I had finished all my refactoring. In other words, I only implemented a really useful tool for type consistency **AFTER I FINISHED PAINSTAKINGLY MESSING WITH ALL THE TYPES**.

That's classic Bry.

That said, my entire code base is officially linter error free, except for two clever little lines I'm proud of but that [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) thinks is a little too clever to be actually readable and maintainable. That's probably true, but we're all allowed our tiny indiscretions.

As per Thursday tradition, here's the list of presentations that happened this week:

* AB debuted his fully-completed web-tutorial/challenge on [SQL Window Functions](https://drill.apache.org/docs/sql-window-functions-introduction/) - think you know your stuff? [Give it a try!](http://windowfunctions.com/)
* AM did her final presentation on the game she's been working on all batch, Just One Boss. I'll link it as soon as its publicly available, but suffice to say it is incredibly polished and enthrallingly hard. Check out some of her other games [here](https://brid.gs/games/). She was one of the two brilliant minds behind [tubin down a river](https://brid.gs/games/tubin-down-a-river), the magnum opus of our generation about tubing lazily down a river.
* LD showed off the process of building a Shakespeare-trained neural net, starting from fairly bad results (57% accuracy on the test set) to a fully-fledged play, with correct spellings and convincing play formatting! He tried using some seed values to start the neural net on different generation paths, like [Eminem lyrics](https://genius.com/Eminem-lose-yourself-lyrics), but the neural net didn't seem to care - back to thous and thys pretty much immediately.
* AR continued her series of [Explorable Explanations](http://explorabl.es/) by showing us a bunch of exciting ways to generate [Sierpinski triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle) with JavaScript and CSS. She also showed off a remarkable result - that the classic [Towers of Hanoi](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-program-for-tower-of-hanoi/) problem can be used to [generate Sierpinski structures](https://www.cut-the-knot.org/triangle/Hanoi.shtml). Stunning!
* LR introduced his struggles with binary I/O in [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) and showed off the truly [opaque, two-line Obj module documentation](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Obj.html).
* PC showed off his journey to making a better user ticketing system for his [monstrously popular Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/full-page-screen-capture/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl?hl=en-US). It's literally sitting at 2.2 million users at time of writing. I'm in batch with incredible, incredible devs - ones that can create such simple extensions that fill such evident and powerful needs.
* JF gave us a rundown on [Critter](https://github.com/modernserf/critter-lang), a 'functional-ish programming language' he's been building over the last three days!

Look at how cool those projects are! What am I even **doing with my life**.

Tonight was also the second half of the RC job fair!

The companies that dropped by tonight were:

* [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/)
* [Opendoor](https://www.opendoor.com/)
* [bread](https://www.getbread.com/#/)
* [droit](http://droitfintech.com/)
* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/h)
* [Hustle](https://hustle.com/)
* [Heap](https://heapanalytics.com/)
* [Alluvium](https://alluvium.io/)
* [Velan](http://velanstudios.com/)
* [AppNexus](https://www.appnexus.com/en)
* [LedgerX](https://ledgerx.com/)
* [Warby Parker](https://www.warbyparker.com/)

I felt like I had a lot more productive conversations tonight, and a lot of the companies seemed extra cool. A number of them are also in the Bay area, which is a big plus considering my internship there this summer.

I also realized I hadn't really given an explanation of how the RC job fair works. Basically, the fair is meant to maximize casualness and minimize stress:

- Recruiters and representatives from each company make their way down to the space
- Each company gets two minutes on stage to pitch their company and the kinds of engineers for which they're looking
- After the presentations, dinner and beer and snacks are served buffet-style
- Everybody mingles around and talks to whoever they want, whenever they want, about whatever they'd like (though a lot of the conversations with recruiters are predictable career-focussed)

There's also a culture of doing your best to make things easier for other Recursers who might not be as adept at navigating the job fair social context - we're encouraged to help out our fellow RCers and keep things as non-competitive or stressful as possible!

It's a lot of fun, and helps keep things relatively casual.

### What I learned

* [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/)
* Something in Prolog??
* PICO-8?
* Something with compilers? Maybe just the lexing and parsing side?
* Something in OCaml??
* SOMETHING FUNCTIONAL (programmatically and literally)
