I wasn't actually planning on writing a blog post for this day, mainly because I thought nothing of note actually happened and it was by far the least productive weekday I've ever had at RC.

To be fair, typically weekends are complete washes, so there's still a ways to go before those records get broken.

Also, spoiler alert, I'm writing this extremely late on Saturday evening, which should just go to show that you can't trust those published-on dates.

This post is likely to be super short due to the lack of actual stuff I did.

### General Thoughts
I feel really guilty/bad about what a terrible day work-wise it was - I spent a lot of time making friends and hanging out, and that's cool and all, but I definitely still have projects on which to be working.

I can't be too annoyed because it was still fun, but I think I might start approaching social stuff the same way I approached the [MIT course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/assignments/) - with at least somewhat stricter timeboxing.

### What I did
So, as I said, I pretty much spent 7+ hours socializing and *maybe 2 hours working*, though that is pretty generous.

It was LS' birthday today at RC, so she planned a couple of food outings! We went to get [hotpot at 99 Favor Taste](https://www.99favortaste.com/) in Chinatown (where CW totally absconded with one of the aprons they provided to us), which took many hours. 

We also went to get ramen at [the original Ippudo](http://www.ippudony.com/), which has the fairly dubious honor of being [the most reviewed restaurant in New York](https://goo.gl/maps/8movZrFGYwN2). 

It's worth noting that the whole time this was going on, I was supposed to be working on [Problem Set 6](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/assignments/MIT6_006F11_ps6.pdf) of the algorithms course, and the group I was hanging with was supposed to be working on the [EvlzCTF](https://evlzctf.in/login?next=challenges). I'm really disliking the coding portions of the problem sets - it really, really, really does not feel like I'm grappling with the algorithm so much as I'm grappling with the files they've provided. I can understand the argument, from a pedagogical standpoint, of forcing students to learn how to wrestle with unfamiliar codebases - it's just not going to help me in an interview, and I don't feel like it's a good use of time.

LS is part of the [CTF](https://blogs.cisco.com/perspectives/cyber-security-capture-the-flag-ctf-what-is-it) team at RC, so the whole team went on all of these adventures.

Suffice to say, we barely got anything done.

I'm proud that I managed to get one of only two flags our team got in between food experiences. However, it was mostly luck, and it was easily the most trivial of all the challenges - a text file containing only tabs and spaces representing binary that could be translated to the flag text.

I wouldn't even have gotten that one if it weren't for CF, one of the more experienced CTF members.

There were some cool challenges I barely got to dip my feet into, like a binary for use on an [Atmel AVR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmel_AVR) board that I tried to find good simulation software to flash onto, and a trippy 30-minute YouTube video with some odd visual and audio artifacts. We hardly even got started though before we went out for ramen!

In general, it looks like the EvlzCTF was at a much higher level of sophistication than the last CTF we did, as evidenced by our relatively poor performance.

I also did another whiteboarding mock interview. I got asked [longest subsequence of unique characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/) and barely managed to solve it in the time given (with a lot of poking and prodding from my interviewer). SE works at Yelp and was one of the nicest interviews I've had - keeping me on track and giving me excellent hints and tips.

It burns, though, becuase I'm certain I've done this question before. In fact, if I log onto my [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) profile I can see I've already written a solution up in the past.

That said, looking over it again I'm surprised the solution I wrote passed - the one I put together during my mock was much more performant, by an order of magnitude.

I suppose that's something.

### What I learned
* Socializing is a really important part of RC, but maybe I need to be a bit more rigorous about the way I approach it? Writing that out makes me feel like a sociopath. I'm really worried about not finishing [open-splendor](https://github.com/farkwun/open-splendor).

### Interests/Stuff to work on
* Splendor in React!
* Morning Golang prep!
* Even more CTF!
* Problem Sets for the [MIT Algos course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/assignments/)
* [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/)
* Something in Prolog??
* PICO-8?
* Something with compilers? Maybe just the lexing and parsing side?
* Something in OCaml??
* SOMETHING FUNCTIONAL (programmatically and literally)
* Kubernetes!
* MongoDB!
