title: "Cake Day"

In preparation for what I knew would be a cake-filled day, I only brought 4 apples for lunch.

It was totally worth it.

### General Thoughts
What an unproductive day and an unproductive week! It's honestly been absolutely awful, I feel like I haven't gotten anything done at all.

I did a bit more refactoring on [open-splendor](https://github.com/farkwun/open-splendor) but I'm starting to get a bit tired of 

a) working with my terrible codebase and 
b) not shipping any features!

I'm making so little progress!

I know my goal was just to make Redux working.

Maybe after this post I'll split out my components and get myself fully set up for [thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk).

### What I did
Today was the last day of the [MIT algos course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/assignments/) and I'm bittersweet about it. 

On the one hand, I was pretty well not investing a lot of time into it, but on the other hand I think it did make me a little more rigorous in my approach to interview questions.

Maybe that's not actually true, but it does kind of feel that way.

Also, it's RS' last week, and he's been with us for the algos course since the beginning! That'll be sad for sure.

The final problem set was focussed on dynamic programming, specifically the [knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem). I think it was also a really great example of how maybe this course isn't super useful, as I felt like I went through most of the problem set without really getting a good intuition for the problem or how to approach dynamic programming problems in general - I didn't watch the lectures though so that might just be a function of me being extremely lazy.

I think the ideas are somewhat coalescing in my mind though - I realized the knapsack problem is one of those extremely common patterns that I have somehow avoided even since the beginning of my interview prep.

I'll try to code up my own solution for the problem in the next couple of days - it's a pretty big blindspot. Talking through it with the group has given me the edges of an insight into the shape of the solution though, so hopefully it'll go well.

I went through a major change in [the Redux branch of open-splendor](https://github.com/farkwun/open-splendor) where I finally ripped out all the static data (for example, the lookup table of possible cards is never going to change) and did a big, big cleanup of the code.

Along the way I cleaned up a few components. I really need to start making progress on the back-end of the application though - there are still a ton of interesting technical challenges ahead of me, especially when it comes to storing game states.

The major reason I didn't get anything done today, though, was because today was the monthly birthdays celebration at RC!

I bought a couple of big cakes from [Junior's](https://www.juniorscheesecake.com/) and carted them with LS and CW back to RC. I also brought [birthday cake Oreos](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Oreo-Birthday-Cake-Chocolate-Sandwich-Cookies-15-25-OZ/23658440) for the vegans! I swear birthday cake Oreos are even better than the originals.

The main cool thing was having to cut the cheesecakes with floss in order to avoid ruining the cake - I think that tip is probably meant for lighter cheesecakes though. Junior's was so thick that we kind of ruined the cakes anyways!

So cake-eating and sugar-highness dominated my entire afternoon and evening.

At least, that's my excuse.

### What I learned
* Intro to the Knapsack problem
* How to cut cake poorly with dental floss

### Interests/Stuff to work on
* Code up Knapsack problem!
* Splendor in React!
* Morning Golang prep!
* Even more CTF!
* [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/)
* Something in Prolog??
* PICO-8?
* Something with compilers? Maybe just the lexing and parsing side?
* Something in OCaml??
* SOMETHING FUNCTIONAL (programmatically and literally)
* Kubernetes!
* MongoDB!
