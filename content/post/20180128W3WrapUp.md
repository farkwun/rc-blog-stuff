title: "Week 3 Wrap Up!"

Today is the end of Week 3, which also marks the end of the first quarter of the batch!

Time has really flown by and I'm starting to freak out *hard* about the amount of work I've managed to accomplish, though I suppose that general anxiety is starting to become a recurring theme throughout these posts.

With that, I'd like to introduce a new section...

### Quarterly Review
So the first three weeks of my RC batch are over and I thought I'd take the opportunity to reflect on everything that's happened over that time period.

I got a lot of social connections that immediately died out when the Mini 1 batch left.

I dipped my toes into a lot of things and started to get a feel for what I did and didn't want to do.

I realized how simultaneously empowering and depressing it is to see people doing things that you never even knew were possible.

In other words, my first three weeks at RC were overwhelming, exciting, stressful, engaging, exhausting, and confusing. 

I've learned a lot, but at the same time, I haven't done a thing - do you see another completed project on my GitHub profile?

I hope next quarter I'll have more positive things to say, but for now, I can only speak in vagaries. I'm having fun, but I don't feel like I'm maximizing along the right dimensions.

### Quick Weekend Thoughts
I've really done absolutely nothing at all productive this weekend, which I think is becoming a huge problem - there might be something major I'm failing to optimize for, as I feel like I'm tired every day but ultimately haven't done much.

I'm also starting to realize I really like doing my laundry and having all my stuff in order - it feels productive even though it's really just the basic stuff I need to do in order to, yknow, survive.

I spent all Saturday hanging out with PABC and WAC playing [7 Wonders](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/68448/7-wonders), [Neuroshima Hex](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/21241/neuroshima-hex), and truly unhealthy amounts of [Coup](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/131357/coup). 

As there's always more programmy stuff to talk about when you're at RC, I also got to have a couple of wonderful conversations with PABC about [MongoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB), specifically its use-cases and its limitations. He started off with [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) and how the core constraints of consistency and atomicity are not reflected in MongoDB, particulary noting that [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID)ity is not something guaranteed by MongoDB.

I found this totally anathema to my current understanding of databases, but it sounds like what MongoDB sacrifices in consistency it makes up for in flexibility - since everything is basically just [JSON](https://www.json.org/), it's really easy to make changes to a data model without having to struggle through [migrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_migration). PABC walked me through some of the advantages of this underlying structure, and I think I'm starting to understand the value proposition.

We also had another conversation about [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) that helped shore up my base conceptual understanding of why it exists and how its meant to be used. PABC's done work with both [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) APIs as well as [RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call)-style systems and walked me through both, finally tying it to GraphQL. My basic understanding is that you define your endpoints within GraphQL, and it then acts as a middle-man - taking in requests from the outside, retrieving data from your specified endpoints, then returning the data that the outside request specifically wanted. If that's a correct understanding, I totally get why you might want something like this!

However, aside from some cool conversations, I got literally nothing done in any meaningful sense.

### Major Thoughts
Objectively, I know I'm learning a lot and doing cool stuff, but I'm starting to really feel anxious about my progress. I feel like I need some alone time or processing time to explore all the interesting things people have mentioned (see: the ever-expanding and noticeably less and less useful "Interests" section below each blog post), but when I'm alone I don't do anything productive.

I feel like I've done a lot of "talking" but not a lot of "doing", and that's getting more and more frustrating to me.

I'm also starting to realize that certain things are probably not that enjoyable or not worth spending too much time on. The things I enjoyed most about the things I worked on this week were the **coding** parts, and I think I should take that more to heart in the coming week.

There's also a big sense of losing steam on the [MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/assignments/) stuff and the [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/) stuff. I really don't think I'm getting a lot out of it, but I'm feeling that [sunk-cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost) super hard.

The major highlights this week were:

* Non-technical talks, especially "Why does NYC's Water Taste so Good?" by LW
* Pairing on [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) with skilled engineers
* Writing that dinky Python script to generate datasets for the [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/) course - it was so useless and stupid but I really enjoyed coding something actually useful
* Figuring out my own [LCA proof](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/assignments/MIT6_006F11_ps3.pdf)
* [Capture the Flag!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security)

### Work Done
I guess I finished the components for the Splendor app.

I talked to JC who told me to forget the CSS and not care how awful it looks - start building out the game logic, validation, and servers, and I guess I can't really disagree.

Aside from that though, it's really starting to feel less and less productive every week - I'm getting pretty distracted every day by this or that course or lecture vid I'm supposed to be watching.

I wish the study groups I was a part of were more like the Capture the Flag stuff - where a bunch of RCers of varying skill levels get together to work on competitions together.

### Big Lessons
I like coding. I should do more of that.

I like pairing. I should do more of that.

There are a lot of security issues that you never get exposed to until you're trying to make stuff break!

### Next Week Goals
Stop loafing on Splendor. Take that leap into the unknown and the frustrating and get things done!

Present next Thursday - even if everything you have sucks!

PAIR WITH SOMEONE ON SOMETHING.

### Interests/Stuff to work on
* More CTF for sure!
* Look into rope series and CRDTs
* SHOW UP FOR MORNING ALGORITHM PREP
* Splendor in React!
* Putting together a more bare-bones neural net for Pytorch
* Rubocop for Metasploit
* Machine-learning client for Parallel Actors - STANDBY
* Problem Sets for the [MIT Algos course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/assignments/)
* [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/)
* Something in Prolog??
* PICO-8?
* Something with compilers? Maybe just the lexing and parsing side?
* Something in OCaml??
* SOMETHING FUNCTIONAL (programmatically and literally)
* Kubernetes!
* MongoDB!
