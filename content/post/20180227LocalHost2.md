I woke up extremely early today (note: 8 AM) in order to eat pancakes with some RC chums and I am fading fast.

I'm not even 100% certain I'm awake right now.

### General Thoughts
Despite my overwhelming fatigue, I actually think today was really great. 

Ignoring the deliciousness of a morning pancake expedition, I think I've fully embraced writing disgusting, disgusting code and not caring about the consequences.

What a wonderful feeling.

I also went hard on some free snacks at the [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/) building where I got to hear a talk by the famous [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/), an RC-er of no small renown.

### What I did
I spent much of the morning struggling with my [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) mock server, which seems wrong - the mock server is supposed to be helping me, not hurting me!

It turns out that [enabling CORS on my POST requests limits the types of data that can be sent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#Examples_of_access_control_scenarios), so I spent much of the morning beating my head against this problem and getting increasingly frustrated.

It didn't help that the entire issue in the first place, [cross-origin resource sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing), is only a problem that exists in my development process. The server that actually serves up the JavaScript is going to be the same one being queried by that code, so this issue won't even exist in production!!!

What a dumb thing to have to worry about.

I also took my first nap at RC, for better or for worse. I woke up and got an impromptu juggling lesson from EM, which was... pretty odd. But also quite amusing, so I can't complain.

Of course, as these things go, I woke up and was able to approach the problem more rationally, and now communication between my server and my client is totally working once again. As per usual, the issue wasn't with the header options (as the type of data I wanted sent, [JSON](https://www.json.org/), is not supported under CORS), but just with doing some more byte encoding on the server side.

Even more as these things go, after I had already resolved the issue, LD linked me to [webpack origin proxying](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) which would have totally solved my problem (apparently, webpack can route outgoing requests to another address on localhost and change the origins - literally the exact thing I'm looking for).

Booooo.

I'll add it later.

LW and I had our first real pairing session today! It was really great, even if not too much work got done. Just like me, LW has only recently been getting into [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), and [middleware](https://redux.js.org/advanced/middleware), and he approached it with a really methodical eye. Specifically, he asked a bunch of questions that helped codify some of the general opinions I've had throughout this process, specifically whether some of these tools are overkill for my application.

I think they may well be, in that there's no major performance or scalability hit that would've occurred regardless of whether my code was the amalgam of technologies it is now vs. a pure React application, but I do also think I learned a lot about how these tools interact with one another and the use cases in which such additional abstractions (despite the significant increase in boilerplate code) *can* be appropriate.

It also helped me get in touch with old Bryan's design decisions. I realized that I had actually written a lot of code that was unnecessary - furthermore, that that unnecessary code was intentionally written just to learn how React components interact with one another! I had forgotten that my initial conception of this project was actually much easier than the snarl I had gotten myself into,  and that the final few steps in this project are going to have a lot of code-pruning and code-simplification.

A rare case where past Bryan was actually smarter than current Bryan, though with 6 hours of sleep over 48 hours maybe its not so hard after all.

As the title suggests, there was also a LocalHost talk today! For those of you not in the know, LocalHost talks are talks given by RC alums about various interesting topics and projects. Notably, they are open to the public and are typically held in the building of one of RC's many business partners.

Julia Evans was presenting, and she gave a really energetic and fascinating talk about building a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) [profiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiling_(computer_programming)) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/).

Also, there were hella snacks. I must have eaten my weight in crackers and dip.

There was also fresh asparagus. So delicious!
